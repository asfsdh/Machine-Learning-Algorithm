'''Trigonometry''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''trigonon'' = three angles and ''metro'' = measure) is a branch of [[mathematics]] dealing with [[angle]]s, [[triangle (geometry)|triangle]]s and '''[[trigonometric function]]s''' such as '''[[sine]]''', '''[[cosine]]''' and '''[[tangent]]'''. It has some relationship to [[geometry]], though there is disagreement on exactly what that relationship is; for some, trigonometry is just a subtopic of geometry.

An '''ambient space''' or '''ambient configuration space''' is the [[dimensional space|space]] surrounding an object.

While the ambient space and [[hodological space]] are both considered ways of perceiving penetrable space, the former perceives space as ''navigable'', while the latter perceives it as ''navigated''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Semiotics of Movement in Space|last=McMurtrie|first=Robert James|date=2017|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781138191716|location=New York|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematics==
[[File:Euclidian and non euclidian geometry.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Three examples of different geometries:  [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]], [[elliptical geometry|elliptical]], and [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]]]]

In [[mathematics]], especially in [[geometry]] and [[topology]], an ''ambient space'' is the space surrounding a [[mathematical object]] along with the object itself.  For example, a [[1 dimension|1-dimensional]] [[line (mathematics)|line]] &lt;math&gt;(l)&lt;/math&gt; may be studied in isolation —in which case the ambient space of &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, or it may be studied as an object embedded in [[Two-dimensional space|2-dimensional]] [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{R}^2)&lt;/math&gt;—in which case the ambient space of &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;, or as an object embedded in 2-dimensional [[hyperbolic space]] &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{H}^2)&lt;/math&gt;—in which case the ambient space of &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}^2&lt;/math&gt;.  To see why this makes a difference, consider the statement "[[parallel (geometry)|Parallel]] lines never intersect."  This is true if the ambient space is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;, but false if the ambient space is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}^2&lt;/math&gt;, because the [[Geometry|geometric properties]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; are different from the geometric properties of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}^2&lt;/math&gt;.  All spaces are [[subset]]s of their ambient space.

The idea of [[mathematical duality]] was first noticed as [[projective duality]]. There it appears as the idea of interchanging dimension ''k'' and [[codimension]] ''k''+1  in propositions of [[projective geometry]]. A large number of duality theories have now been created in mathematics, ranging as far as [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization theory]] and [[theoretical physics]].

      <comment>/* The superspace of supersymmetric quantum mechanics */  Some wrong signs in the expressions of the Q operator which lead to wrong signs in the calculation of the action of Q over superfields</comment>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text bytes="15035" xml:space="preserve">'''Superspace''' is the coordinate space of a theory exhibiting [[supersymmetry]]. In such a formulation, along with ordinary space dimensions ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ..., there are also "anticommuting" dimensions whose coordinates are labeled in [[Grassmann number]]s rather than real numbers. The ordinary space dimensions correspond to [[boson]]ic degrees of freedom, the anticommuting dimensions to [[fermionic]] degrees of freedom.

The word "superspace" was first used by [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] in an unrelated sense to describe the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] of [[general relativity]]; for example, this usage may be seen in his 1973 textbook ''[[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]]''.

==Informal discussion==
There are several similar, but not equivalent, definitions of superspace that have been used, and continue to be used in the mathematical and physics literature. One such usage is as a synonym for [[super Minkowski space]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sylvester James Gates|S. J. Gates, Jr.]], [[Marcus T. Grisaru|M. T. Grisaru]], [[Martin Rocek|M. Roček]], [[Warren Siegel|W. Siegel]], ''Superspace or One Thousand and One Lessons in Supersymmetry'', Benjamins Cumming Publishing (1983) {{ISBN|0-8053 3161-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, one takes ordinary [[Minkowski space]], and extends it with anti-commuting fermionic degrees of freedom, taken to be anti-commuting [[Weyl spinor]]s from the [[Clifford algebra]] associated to the [[Lorentz group]]. Equivalently, the super Minkowski space can be understood as the quotient of the [[super Poincaré algebra]] modulo the algebra of the Lorentz group. A typical notation for the coordinates on such a space is &lt;math&gt;(x,\theta,\bar{\theta})&lt;/math&gt; with the overline being the give-away that super Minkowski space is the intended space.

Superspace is also commonly used as a synonym for the [[super vector space]]. This is taken to be an ordinary [[vector space]], together with additional coordinates taken from the [[Grassmann algebra]], i.e. coordinate directions that are [[Grassmann number]]s.  There are several conventions for constructing a super vector space in use; two of these are described by Rogers&lt;ref name="rogers"&gt;[[Alice Rogers]], ''Supermanifolds: Theory and Applications'', World Scientific (2007) {{ISBN|978-981-3203-21-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and DeWitt.&lt;ref name="dewitt"&gt;[[Bryce DeWitt]], ''Supermanifolds'', Cambridge University Press (1984) {{ISBN|0521 42377 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third usage of the term "superspace" is as a synonym for a [[supermanifold]]: a supersymmetric generalization of a [[manifold]]. Note that both super Minkowski spaces and super vector spaces can be taken as special cases of supermanifolds.

A fourth, and completely unrelated meaning saw a brief usage in [[general relativity]]; this is discussed in greater detail at the bottom.

==Examples==
Several examples are given below. The first few assume a definition of superspace as a [[super vector space]].  This is denoted as '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''|''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, the '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-[[graded vector space]] with '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; as the even subspace and '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; as the odd subspace. The same definition applies to '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;m|n&lt;/sup&gt;.

The four-dimensional examples take superspace to be [[super Minkowski space]]. Although similar to a vector space, this has many important differences: First of all, it is an [[affine space]], having no special point denoting the origin.  Next, the fermionic coordinates are taken to be anti-commuting [[Weyl spinor]]s from the [[Clifford algebra]], rather than being [[Grassmann number]]s. The difference here is that the Clifford algebra has a considerably richer and more subtle structure than the Grassmann numbers.  So, the Grassmann numbers are elements of the [[exterior algebra]], and the Clifford algebra has an isomorphism to the exterior algebra, but its relation to the [[orthogonal group]] and the [[spin group]], used to construct the [[spin representation]]s, give it a deep geometric significance. (For example, the spin groups form a normal part of the study of [[Riemannian geometry]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Jost]], ''Riemannian Geometry and Geometric Analysis'', Springer-Verlag (2002) {{ISBN|3-540-63654-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; quite outside the ordinary bounds and concerns of physics.)

===Trivial examples===

The smallest superspace is a point which contains neither bosonic nor fermionic directions.  Other trivial examples include the ''n''-dimensional real plane '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, which is a [[vector space]] extending in ''n'' real, bosonic directions and no fermionic directions.  The vector space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;0|n&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the ''n''-dimensional real [[Grassmann algebra]].  The space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1|1&lt;/sup&gt; of one even and one odd direction is known as the space of [[dual number]]s, introduced by [[William Kingdon Clifford|William Clifford]] in 1873.

===The superspace of supersymmetric quantum mechanics===
[[Supersymmetric quantum mechanics]] with ''N'' [[supercharge]]s is often formulated in the superspace '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1|2''N''&lt;/sup&gt;, which contains one real direction ''t'' identified with [[time]] and ''N'' complex [[Grassmann number|Grassmann directions]] which are spanned by  Θ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and  Θ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''i'' runs from 1 to ''N''.

Consider the special case ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.  The superspace '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1|2&lt;/sup&gt; is a 3-dimensional vector space.  A given coordinate therefore may be written as a triple (''t'', Θ, Θ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;).  The coordinates form a [[Lie superalgebra]], in which the gradation degree of ''t'' is even and that of Θ and Θ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is odd.  This means that a bracket may be defined between any two elements of this vector space, and that this bracket reduces to the [[commutator]] on two even coordinates and on one even and one odd coordinate while it is an [[anticommutator]] on two odd coordinates.  This superspace is an abelian Lie superalgebra, which means that all of the aforementioned brackets vanish

:::&lt;math&gt;\left[ t,t\right]=\left[ t, \theta\right]=\left[ t, \theta^*\right]=\left\{\theta, \theta\right\}=\left\{ \theta, \theta^*\right\} =\left\{ \theta^*, \theta^*\right\}=0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; is the commutator of ''a'' and ''b'' and &lt;math&gt;\{a,b\}&lt;/math&gt; is the anticommutator of ''a'' and ''b''.

One may define functions from this vector space to itself, which are called [[superfield]]s. The above algebraic relations imply that, if we expand our superfield as a [[power series]] in Θ and Θ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, then we will only find terms at the zeroeth and first orders, because Θ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Θ&lt;sup&gt;*2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.  Therefore, superfields may be written as arbitrary functions of ''t'' multiplied by the zeroeth and first order terms in the two Grassmann coordinates

:::&lt;math&gt;\Phi \left(t,\Theta,\Theta^* \right)=\phi(t)+\Theta\Psi(t)-\Theta^*\Phi^*(t)+\Theta\Theta^* F(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Superfields, which are representations of the [[supersymmetry]] of superspace, generalize the notion of [[tensor]]s, which are representations of the rotation group of a bosonic space.

One may then define derivatives in the Grassmann directions, which take the first order term in the expansion of a superfield to the zeroeth order term and annihilate the zeroeth order term.  One can choose sign conventions such that the derivatives satisfy the anticommutation relations

:::&lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\,,\Theta\right\}=\left\{\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta^*}\,,\Theta^*\right\}=1&lt;/math&gt;

These derivatives may be assembled into [[supercharge]]s

:::&lt;math&gt;Q=\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}-i\Theta^*\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\quad \text{and} \quad Q^\dagger=\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta^*}+i\Theta\frac{\partial}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

whose anticommutators identify them as the fermionic generators of a [[supersymmetry]] algebra

:::&lt;math&gt;\left\{ Q,Q^\dagger\,\right\}=2i\frac{\partial}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''i'' times the time derivative is the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] operator in [[quantum mechanics]].  Both ''Q'' and its adjoint anticommute with themselves.  The supersymmetry variation with supersymmetry parameter ε of a superfield Φ is defined to be

:::&lt;math&gt;\delta_\epsilon\Phi=(\epsilon^* Q+\epsilon Q^\dagger)\Phi.&lt;/math&gt;

We can evaluate this variation using the action of ''Q'' on the superfields

:::&lt;math&gt;\left[Q,\Phi \right]=\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\,-i\theta^*\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\right)\Phi=\psi+\theta^*\left(F-i\dot{\phi}\right)+i\theta\theta^*\dot{\psi}.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly one may define [[covariant derivative]]s on superspace

:::&lt;math&gt;D=\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}-i\theta^*\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\quad \text{and} \quad D^\dagger=\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta^*}-i\theta\frac{\partial}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

which anticommute with the supercharges and satisfy a wrong sign supersymmetry algebra

:::&lt;math&gt;\left\{D,D^\dagger\right\}=-2i\frac{\partial}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;.

The fact that the covariant derivatives anticommute with the supercharges means the supersymmetry transformation of a covariant derivative of a superfield is equal to the covariant derivative of the same supersymmetry transformation of the same superfield.  Thus, generalizing the covariant derivative in bosonic geometry which constructs tensors from tensors, the superspace covariant derivative constructs superfields from superfields.

===Four-dimensional ''N'' = 1 superspace&lt;!--'Bosonic dimension', 'Bosonic dimensions', 'Grassmann dimension', 'Grassmann dimensions', 'Fermionic dimension', and 'Fermionic dimensions' redirect here--&gt;===

Perhaps the most popular superspace in [[physics]] is ''d''=4 ''N''=1 [[super Minkowski space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4|4&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]] of four real '''bosonic dimensions'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; and four real '''Grassmann dimensions'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (also known as '''fermionic dimensions'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;[[Yuval Ne'eman]], Elena Eizenberg, ''Membranes and Other Extendons (p-branes)'', World Scientific, 1995,  p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[supersymmetric]] [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] one is interested in superspaces which furnish [[group representation|representations]] of a [[Lie superalgebra]] called a [[supersymmetry algebra]].  The bosonic part of the supersymmetry algebra is the [[Poincaré algebra]], while the fermionic part is constructed using [[spinor]]s of Grassmann numbers.

For this reason, in physical applications one considers an action of the supersymmetry algebra on the four fermionic directions of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4|4&lt;/sup&gt; such that they transform as a [[spinor]] under the Poincaré subalgebra.  In four dimensions there are three distinct irreducible 4-component spinors.  There is the [[Majorana spinor]], the left-handed [[Weyl spinor]] and the right-handed Weyl spinor.  The [[CPT theorem]] implies that in a [[Unitarity (physics)|unitary]], Poincaré invariant theory, which is a theory in which the [[S-matrix]] is a [[unitary matrix]] and the same Poincaré generators act on the asymptotic in-states as on the asymptotic out-states, the supersymmetry algebra must contain an equal number of left-handed and right-handed Weyl spinors.  However, since each Weyl spinor has four components, this means that if one includes any Weyl spinors one must have 8 fermionic directions.  Such a theory is said to have [[extended supersymmetry]], and such models have received a lot of attention.  For example, supersymmetric gauge theories with eight supercharges and fundamental matter have been solved by [[Nathan Seiberg]] and [[Edward Witten]], see [[Seiberg–Witten gauge theory]].  However, in this subsection we are considering the superspace with four fermionic components and so no Weyl spinors are consistent with the CPT theorem.

''Note'': There are many [[sign convention]]s in use and this is only one of them.

This leaves us with one possibility, the four fermionic directions transform as a Majorana spinor θ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;.  We can also form a conjugate spinor

:::&lt;math&gt;\overline{\theta}\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\   i\theta^\dagger\gamma^0=-\theta^\perp C&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' is the charge conjugation matrix, which is defined by the property that when it conjugates a [[gamma matrix]], the gamma matrix is negated and transposed.  The first equality is the definition of {{Overline|θ}} while the second is a consequence of the Majorana spinor condition θ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;iγ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;Cθ.  The conjugate spinor plays a role similar to that of  θ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; in the superspace '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1|2&lt;/sup&gt;, except that the Majorana condition, as manifested in the above equation, imposes that θ and θ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; are not independent.

In particular we may construct the supercharges

:::&lt;math&gt;Q=-\frac{\partial}{\partial\overline{\theta}}+\gamma^\mu\theta\partial_\mu&lt;/math&gt;

which satisfy the supersymmetry algebra

:::&lt;math&gt;\left\{Q,Q\right\}=\left\{\overline{Q},Q\right\}C=2\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu C=-2i\gamma^\mu P_\mu C&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P=i\partial_\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the 4-[[momentum]] operator.  Again the covariant derivative is defined like the supercharge but with the second term negated and it anticommutes with the supercharges. Thus the covariant derivative of a supermultiplet is another supermultiplet.

==In general relativity==
The word "superspace" is also used in a completely different and unrelated sense, in the book [[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]] by Misner, Thorne and Wheeler.  There, it refers to the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] of [[general relativity]], and, in particular, the view of gravitation as [[geometrodynamics]], an interpretation of general relativity as a form of dynamical geometry. In modern terms, this particular idea of "superspace" is captured in one of several different formalisms used in solving the Einstein equations in a variety of settings, both theoretical and practical, such as in numerical simulations. This includes primarily the [[ADM formalism]], as well as ideas surrounding the [[Hamilton–Jacobi–Einstein equation]] and the [[Wheeler–DeWitt equation]].

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text bytes="4224" xml:space="preserve">In [[geometry]], Dehn introduced two examples of planes, a '''semi-Euclidean geometry''' and a '''non-Legendrian geometry''', that have infinitely many lines parallel to a given one that pass through a given point, but where the sum of the angles of a triangle is at least π.  A similar phenomenon occurs in [[hyperbolic geometry]], except that the sum of the angles of a triangle is less than π.   Dehn's examples use a non-Archimedean field, so that the [[Archimedean axiom]] is violated.  They were introduced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Max Dehn|first=Max |last=Dehn|year=1900}} and discussed by {{harvtxt|Hilbert|1902|loc=p.127–130, or p. 42-43 in some later editions}}.

==Dehn's non-archimedean field Ω(''t'')==

To construct his geometries, Dehn used a [[Archimedean property|non-Archimedean]] ordered [[Pythagorean field]] Ω(''t''), a [[Pythagorean closure]] of the field of rational functions '''R'''(''t''),  consisting of the smallest field of real-valued functions on the real line containing the real constants, the identity function ''t'' (taking any real number to itself) and closed under the operation ω → {{radic|1+ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The field Ω(''t'') is ordered by putting ''x''&gt;''y'' if the function ''x'' is larger than ''y'' for sufficiently large reals. An element ''x'' of Ω(''t'') is called '''finite''' if ''m''&lt;''x''&lt;''n'' for some integers ''m'',''n'', and is called '''infinite''' otherwise.

==Dehn's semi-Euclidean geometry==

The set of all pairs (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y''), where ''x'' and ''y'' are any (possibly infinite) elements of the field Ω(''t''), and with the usual [[metric (mathematics)|metric]]

: &lt;math&gt;||(x,y)|| = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}, &lt;/math&gt;

which takes values in Ω(''t''), gives a model of [[Euclidean geometry]]. The parallel postulate is true in this model, but if the deviation from the perpendicular is infinitesimal (meaning smaller than any positive rational number), the intersecting lines intersect at a point that is not in the finite part of the plane.  Hence, if the model is restricted to the finite part of the plane (points (''x'',''y'') with ''x'' and ''y'' finite), a geometry is obtained in which the parallel postulate fails but the sum of the angles of a triangle is π. This is Dehn's semi-Euclidean geometry. It is discussed in {{harvtxt|Rucker|1982|loc=pages 91-2}}.

==Dehn's non-Legendrian geometry==

In the same paper, Dehn also constructed an example of a non-Legendrian geometry where there are infinitely many lines through a point not meeting another line, but the sum of the angles in a triangle exceeds π. Riemann's [[elliptic geometry]] over Ω(''t'') consists of the projective plane over Ω(''t''), which can be identified with the affine plane of points (''x'':''y'':1) together with the "line at infinity", and has the property that the sum of the angles of any triangle is greater than π The non-Legendrian geometry consists of the points  (''x'':''y'':1) of this affine subspace such that ''tx'' and ''ty'' are finite (where as above ''t'' is the element of Ω(''t'') represented by the identity function). [[Saccheri–Legendre theorem|Legendre's theorem]] states that the sum of the angles of a triangle is at most π, but assumes Archimedes's axiom, and Dehn's example shows that Legendre's theorem need not hold if Archimedes' axiom is dropped.

      <text bytes="28199" xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], a '''complex reflection group''' is a [[Group (mathematics)|finite group]] acting on a [[finite-dimensional vector space|finite-dimensional]] [[complex numbers|complex]] [[vector space]] that is generated by '''complex reflections''': non-trivial elements that fix a complex [[hyperplane]] pointwise.

Complex reflection groups arise in the study of the [[invariant theory]] of [[polynomial ring]]s.  In the mid-20th century, they were completely classified in work of Shephard and Todd.  Special cases include the [[symmetric group]] of permutations, the [[dihedral group]]s, and more generally all finite real reflection groups (the [[Coxeter group]]s or [[Weyl group]]s, including the symmetry groups of [[regular polyhedron|regular polyhedra]]).

==Definition==

A (complex) reflection ''r'' (sometimes also called ''pseudo reflection'' or ''unitary reflection'') of a finite-dimensional complex vector space ''V'' is an element &lt;math&gt;r \in GL(V)&lt;/math&gt; of finite order that fixes a complex hyperplane pointwise, that is, the ''fixed-space'' &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Fix}(r) := \operatorname{ker}(r-\operatorname{Id}_V)&lt;/math&gt; has codimension 1.

A ('''finite''') '''complex reflection group''' &lt;math&gt;W \subseteq GL(V)&lt;/math&gt; is a finite subgroup of &lt;math&gt;GL(V)&lt;/math&gt; that is generated by reflections.

==Properties==

Any real reflection group becomes a complex reflection group if we extend the scalars from 
'''R''' to '''C'''. In particular all [[Coxeter group]]s or [[Weyl group]]s give examples of complex reflection groups.

A complex reflection group ''W'' is '''irreducible''' if the only ''W''-invariant proper subspace of the corresponding vector space is the origin. In this case, the dimension of the vector space is called the '''rank''' of ''W''.

The '''Coxeter number''' &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; of an irreducible complex reflection group ''W'' of rank &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;h = \frac{|\mathcal{R}|+|\mathcal{A}|}{n}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of reflections and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of reflecting hyperplanes.
In the case of real reflection groups, this definition reduces to the usual definition of the Coxeter number for finite Coxeter systems.

==Classification==

Any complex reflection group is a product of irreducible complex reflection groups, acting on the sum of the corresponding vector spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Lehrer and Taylor, Theorem 1.27.&lt;/ref&gt; So it is sufficient to classify the irreducible complex reflection groups.

The irreducible complex reflection groups were classified by {{Harvs |txt |first=G. C. |last=Shephard |author1-link=Geoffrey Colin Shephard|first2=J. A. |last2=Todd |author2-link=J. A. Todd |year=1954}}. They proved that every irreducible belonged to an infinite family ''G''(''m'', ''p'', ''n'') depending on 3 positive integer parameters (with ''p'' dividing ''m'') or was one of 34 exceptional cases, which they numbered from 4 to 37.&lt;ref&gt;Lehrer and Taylor, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;  The group ''G''(''m'', 1, ''n'') is the [[generalized symmetric group]]; equivalently, it is the [[wreath product]] of the symmetric group Sym(''n'') by a cyclic group of order ''m''.  As a matrix group, its elements may be realized as [[monomial matrices]] whose nonzero elements are ''m''th [[roots of unity]].

The group ''G''(''m'', ''p'', ''n'') is an [[index of a subgroup|index-''p'']] subgroup of ''G''(''m'', 1, ''n''). ''G''(''m'', ''p'', ''n'') is of order ''m''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''n''!/''p''. As matrices, it may be realized as the subset in which the product of the nonzero entries is an (''m''/''p'')th root of unity (rather than just an ''m''th root).  Algebraically, ''G''(''m'', ''p'', ''n'') is a [[semidirect product]] of an abelian group of order ''m''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;/''p'' by the symmetric group Sym(''n''); the elements of the abelian group are of the form (''θ''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, ''θ''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., ''θ''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;), where ''θ'' is a [[primitive root of unity|primitive]] ''m''th root of unity and ∑''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ 0 mod ''p'', and Sym(''n'') acts by permutations of the coordinates.&lt;ref&gt;Lehrer and Taylor, Section 2.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group ''G''(''m'',''p'',''n'') acts irreducibly on '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; except in the cases ''m'' = 1, ''n'' &gt; 1 (the symmetric group) and ''G''(2, 2, 2) (the [[Klein four-group]]).  In these cases, '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; splits as a sum of irreducible representations of dimensions 1 and ''n'' − 1.

===Special cases of ''G''(''m'', ''p'', ''n'')===
====[[Coxeter group]]s====
When ''m'' = 2, the representation described in the previous section consists of matrices with real entries, and hence in these cases ''G''(''m'',''p'',''n'') is a finite Coxeter group.  In particular:&lt;ref&gt;Lehrer and Taylor, Example 2.11.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''G''(1, 1, ''n'') has type ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; = [3,3,...,3,3] = {{CDD|node|3|node|3}}...{{CDD|3|node|3|node}}; the symmetric group of order ''n''!
* ''G''(2, 1, ''n'') has type ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = [3,3,...,3,4] = {{CDD|node|3|node|3}}...{{CDD|3|node|4|node}}; the [[hyperoctahedral group]] of order 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''n''!
* ''G''(2, 2, ''n'') has type ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = [3,3,...,3&lt;sup&gt;1,1&lt;/sup&gt;] = {{CDD|node|3|node|3}}...{{CDD|3|node|split1|nodes}}, order 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''n''!/2.

In addition, when ''m'' = ''p'' and ''n'' = 2, the group ''G''(''p'', ''p'', 2) is the [[dihedral group]] of order 2''p''; as a Coxeter group, type ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'') = [''p''] = {{CDD|branch|labelp}} (and the Weyl group ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; when ''p'' = 6).

====Other special cases and coincidences====
The only cases when two groups ''G''(''m'', ''p'', ''n'') are isomorphic as complex reflection groups{{clarify|What exactly does this mean?  Any why G(2, 1, 2) and G(4, 4, 2) is not a counter-example, for example?  This does not seem supported by Lehrer--Taylor, p. 271.|date=April 2020}} are that ''G''(''ma'', ''pa'', 1) is isomorphic to ''G''(''mb'', ''pb'', 1) for any positive integers ''a'', ''b'' (and both are isomorphic to the [[cyclic group]] of order ''m''/''p'').  However, there are other cases when two such groups are isomorphic as abstract groups.

The groups ''G''(3, 3, 2) and ''G''(1, 1, 3) are isomorphic to the symmetric group Sym(3).  The groups ''G''(2, 2, 3) and ''G''(1, 1, 4) are isomorphic to the symmetric group Sym(4).  Both ''G''(2, 1, 2) and ''G''(4, 4, 2) are isomorphic to the [[dihedral group]] of order 8.  And the groups ''G''(2''p'', ''p'', 1) are cyclic of order 2, as is ''G''(1, 1, 2).

==List of irreducible complex reflection groups==
There are a few duplicates in the first 3 lines of this list; see the previous section for details.
*'''ST''' is the Shephard&amp;ndash;Todd number of the reflection group.
*'''Rank''' is the dimension of the complex vector space the group acts on.
*'''Structure''' describes the structure of the group. The symbol * stands for a [[central product]] of two groups. For rank 2, the quotient by the (cyclic) center is the group of rotations of a tetrahedron, octahedron, or icosahedron (''T'' = Alt(4), ''O'' = Sym(4), ''I'' = Alt(5), of orders 12, 24, 60), as stated in the table. For the notation 2&lt;sup&gt;1+4&lt;/sup&gt;, see [[extra special group]].
*'''Order''' is the number of elements of the group.
*'''Reflections''' describes the number of reflections: 2&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;4&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; means that there are 6 reflections of order 2 and 12 of order 4.
*'''Degrees''' gives the degrees of the fundamental invariants of the ring of polynomial invariants. For example, the invariants of group number 4 form a polynomial ring with 2 generators of degrees 4 and 6.

==Degrees==

Shephard and  Todd proved that a finite group acting on a complex vector space is a complex reflection group if and only if its ring of invariants is a polynomial ring ([[Chevalley–Shephard–Todd theorem]]). For &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; being the ''rank'' of the reflection group, the degrees &lt;math&gt;d_1 \leq d_2 \leq \ldots \leq d_\ell&lt;/math&gt; of the generators of the ring of invariants are called ''degrees of W'' and are listed in the column above headed "degrees". They also showed that many other invariants of the group are determined by the degrees as follows:

*The center of an irreducible reflection group is cyclic of order equal to the greatest common divisor of the degrees.
*The order of a complex reflection group is the product of its degrees.
*The number of reflections is the sum of the degrees minus the rank.
*An irreducible complex reflection group comes from a real reflection group if and only if it has an invariant of degree 2.
*The degrees ''d''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; satisfy the formula &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i=1}^\ell(q+d_i-1)= \sum_{w\in W}q^{\dim(V^w)}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Codegrees==

For &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; being the ''rank'' of the reflection group, the codegrees &lt;math&gt;d^*_1 \geq d^*_2 \geq \ldots \geq d^*_\ell&lt;/math&gt; of W can be defined by
&lt;math&gt;\prod_{i=1}^\ell(q-d^*_i-1)= \sum_{w\in W}\det(w)q^{\dim(V^w)}.&lt;/math&gt;

*For a real reflection group, the codegrees are the degrees minus 2.
*The number of reflection hyperplanes is the sum of the codegrees plus the rank.

==Well-generated complex reflection groups==

By definition, every complex reflection group is generated by its reflections.  The set of reflections is not a minimal generating set, however, and every irreducible complex reflection groups of rank {{math|''n''}} has a minimal generating set consisting of either {{math|''n''}} or {{math|''n'' + 1}} reflections.  In the former case, the group is said to be ''well-generated''.

The property of being well-generated is equivalent to the condition &lt;math&gt;d_i + d^*_i = d_\ell&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;1 \leq i \leq \ell&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, for example, one can read off from the classification that the group {{math|''G''(''m'', ''p'', ''n'')}} is well-generated if and only if ''p'' = 1 or ''m''.

For irreducible well-generated complex reflection groups, the ''[[Coxeter number]]'' {{math|''h''}} defined above equals the largest degree, &lt;math&gt;h = d_\ell&lt;/math&gt;. A reducible complex reflection group is said to be well-generated if it is a product of irreducible well-generated complex reflection groups. Every finite real reflection group is well-generated.

==Shephard groups==

The well-generated complex reflection groups include a subset called the ''Shephard groups''.  These groups are the symmetry groups of [[regular complex polytope]]s.  In particular, they include the symmetry groups of regular real polyhedra.  The Shephard groups may be characterized as the complex reflection groups that admit a "Coxeter-like" presentation with a linear diagram.  That is, a Shephard group has associated positive integers {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;}} such that there is a generating set {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} satisfying the relations
: &lt;math&gt;(s_i)^{p_i} = 1&lt;/math&gt; for {{math|''i'' {{=}} 1, …, ''n''}},
: &lt;math&gt; s_i s_j = s_j s_i&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;|i - j| &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, 
and
: &lt;math&gt; s_i s_{i + 1}s_i s_{i + 1} \cdots = s_{i + 1}s_i s_{i + 1}s_i \cdots&lt;/math&gt; where the products on both sides have {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} terms, for {{math|''i'' {{=}} 1, …, ''n'' − 1}}.

This information is sometimes collected in the Coxeter-type symbol {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;[''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] … [''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;]''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, as seen in the table above.

Among groups in the infinite family {{math|''G''(''m'', ''p'', ''n'')}}, the Shephard groups are those in which {{math|''p'' {{=}} 1}}.  There are also 18 exceptional Shephard groups, of which three are real.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Orlik]], Victor Reiner, Anne V. Shepler. ''The sign representation for Shephard groups''. ''Mathematische Annalen''. March 2002, Volume 322, Issue 3, pp 477–492. DOI:10.1007/s002080200001 [http://www.math.unt.edu/~ashepler/papers/ORS.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|Coxeter, H. S. M.]]; ''Regular Complex Polytopes'', Cambridge University Press, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cartan matrices ==
An extended [[Cartan matrix]] defines the Unitary group. Shephard groups of rank ''n'' group have ''n'' generators.

Ordinary Cartan matrices have diagonal elements 2, while unitary reflections do not have this restriction.&lt;ref&gt;Unitary Reflection Groups, pp.91-93&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the rank 1 group, p[], {{CDD|pnode}}, is defined by a 1×1 matrix [1-&lt;math&gt;e^{2\pi i/p}&lt;/math&gt;].

Given: &lt;math&gt;\zeta_p = e^{2\pi i/p}, \omega \ \zeta_3 = e^{2\pi i/3} = \tfrac{1}{2}(-1+i\sqrt{3}), \zeta_4 = e^{2\pi i/4} = i, \zeta_5 = e^{2\pi i/5} = \tfrac{1}{4}(\left(\sqrt5-1\right) + i\sqrt{2(5+\sqrt5)}), \tau = \tfrac{1+\sqrt5}{2}, \lambda = \tfrac{1+i\sqrt7}{2}, \omega = \tfrac{-1+i\sqrt3}{2} &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Geometric graph theory''' is a branch of [[graph theory]]. It concerns straight-line embeddings of graphs in geometric spaces and graphs defined from configurations in a geometric space. See also [[:Category:Topological graph theory]] for more general embeddings of graphs in surfaces, and [[:Category:Graph drawing]] for the use of geometric representations in the visualization of graphs.

      <text bytes="3612" xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], a '''Lipschitz domain''' (or '''domain with Lipschitz boundary''') is a [[Domain (mathematical analysis)|domain]] in [[Euclidean space]] whose boundary is "sufficiently regular" in the sense that it can be thought of as locally being the graph of a [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz continuous function]]. The term is named after the [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] [[Rudolf Lipschitz]].

==Definition==

Let &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb N&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Domain (mathematical analysis)|domain]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;\partial\Omega&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''Lipschitz domain''' if for every point &lt;math&gt;p \in \partial\Omega&lt;/math&gt; there exists a hyperplane &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; of dimension &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; through &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, a Lipschitz-continuous function &lt;math&gt;g : H \rightarrow \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; over that hyperplane, and reals &lt;math&gt;r &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that
* &lt;math&gt;\Omega \cap C = \left\{x + y \vec{n} \mid x \in B_r(p) \cap H,\ -h &lt; y &lt; g(x) \right\}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(\partial\Omega) \cap C = \left\{x + y \vec{n} \mid x \in B_r(p) \cap H,\ g(x) = y \right\}&lt;/math&gt;
where 
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{n}&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector that is normal to &lt;math&gt;H,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B_{r} (p) := \{x \in \mathbb{R}^{n} \mid \| x - p \| &lt; r \}&lt;/math&gt; is the open ball of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;C := \left\{x + y \vec{n} \mid x \in B_r(p) \cap H,\ -h &lt; y &lt; h \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, at each point of its boundary, &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is locally the set of points located above the graph of some Lipschitz function. 

== Generalization ==

A more general notion is that of '''weakly Lipschitz''' domains, which are domains whose boundary is locally flattable by a bilipschitz mapping. Lipschitz domains in the sense above are sometimes called '''strongly Lipschitz''' by contrast with weakly Lipschitz domains. 

A domain &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is '''weakly Lipschitz''' if for every point &lt;math&gt;p \in \partial\Omega,&lt;/math&gt; there exists a radius &lt;math&gt;r &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and a map &lt;math&gt;l_p : B_r(p) \rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; such that
* &lt;math&gt;l_p&lt;/math&gt; is a [[bijection]];
* &lt;math&gt;l_p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l_p^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; are both Lipschitz continuous functions;
* &lt;math&gt;l_p\left( \partial\Omega \cap B_r(p) \right) = Q_0;&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;l_p\left( \Omega \cap B_r(p) \right) = Q_+;&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; denotes the unit ball &lt;math&gt;B_1(0)&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt;Q_{0} := \{(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}) \in Q \mid x_{n} = 0 \};&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Q_{+} := \{(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}) \in Q \mid x_{n} &gt; 0 \}.&lt;/math&gt;

A (strongly) Lipschitz domain is always a weakly Lipschitz domain but the converse is not true. An example of weakly Lipschitz domains that fails to be a strongly Lipschitz domain is given by the '''two-bricks''' domain &lt;ref&gt;Werner Licht, M. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02756 "Smoothed Projections over Weakly Lipschitz Domains"], ''[[arXiv]]'', 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;



==Applications of Lipschitz domains==

Many of the [[Sobolev inequality|Sobolev embedding theorems]] require that the domain of study be a Lipschitz domain. Consequently, many [[partial differential equation]]s and [[calculus of variations|variational problems]] are defined on Lipschitz domains.

      <text bytes="2827" xml:space="preserve">'''Visibility''' in [[geometry]] is a mathematical [[abstraction]] of the real-life notion of visibility.

Given a set of obstacles in the [[Euclidean space]], two points in the space are said to be '''visible to each other''', if the line segment that joins them does not intersect any obstacles. (In the [[Earth's atmosphere]] light follows a slightly curved path that is not perfectly predictable, complicating the calculation of actual visibility.)

Computation of visibility is among the basic problems in [[computational geometry]] and has applications in  [[computer graphics]], [[motion planning]], and other areas.

{{Spacetime|cTopic=Types}}
A '''spacetime diagram''' is a graphical illustration of the properties of space and time in the [[special theory of relativity]]. Spacetime diagrams allow a qualitative understanding of the corresponding phenomena like [[time dilation]] and [[length contraction]] without mathematical equations.

The history of an object's location throughout all time traces out a line, referred to as the object's [[world line]], in a spacetime diagram. Points in spacetime diagrams represent a fixed position in space and time and are referred to as [[Event (relativity)|events]].

The most well-known class of spacetime diagrams are known as '''Minkowski diagrams''', developed by [[Hermann Minkowski]] in 1908. Minkowski diagrams are two-dimensional graphs that depict events as happening in a [[universe]] consisting of one space dimension and one time dimension. Unlike a regular distance-time graph, the distance is displayed on the horizontal axis and time on the vertical axis. Additionally, the time and space [[units of measurement]] are chosen in such a way that an object moving at the speed of light is depicted as following a 45° angle to the diagram's axes.

== Introduction to kinetic diagrams ==
=== Position versus time graphs ===
[[File:Distance-time graph example.svg|thumb]]
In the study of 1-dimensional kinematics, position vs. time graphs (also called distance vs. time graphs, or p-t graphs) provide a useful means to describe motion. The specific features of the motion of objects are demonstrated by the shape and the slope of the lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What are position vs. time graphs? |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/one-dimensional-motion/displacement-velocity-time/a/position-vs-time-graphs |publisher=Khan Academy |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the accompanying figure, the plotted object moves away from the origin at a uniform speed of 1.66&amp;nbsp;m/s for six seconds, halts for five seconds, then returns to the origin over a period of seven seconds at a non-constant speed.

At its most basic level, a spacetime diagram is merely a time vs position graph, with the directions of the axes in a usual p-t graph exchanged, that is, the vertical axis refers to temporal and the horizontal axis to spatial coordinate values. Especially when used in [[special relativity]] (SR), the temporal axes of a spacetime diagram are scaled with the speed of light {{mvar|c}}, and thus are often labeled by {{mvar|ct.}} This changes the dimension of the addressed physical quantity from &lt;''Time''&gt; to &lt;''Length''&gt;, in accordance to the dimension associated to the spatial axes, which are frequently labeled {{mvar|x.}}

=== Standard configuration of reference frames ===
[[File:Standard configuration of coordinate systems.svg|thumb|Galilean diagram of two frames of reference in standard configuration.]]

To ease insight in how spacetime coordinates, measured by observers in different [[Inertial frame of reference|reference frames]], compare with each other, it is useful to work with a simplified setup. With care, this allows simplification of the math with no loss of generality in the conclusions that are reached. Setting the temporal component aside for the moment, two  [[Galilean reference frame]]s (i.e. conventional 3-space frames), S and S' (pronounced "S&amp;nbsp;prime"), each with observers O and O' at rest in their respective frames, but measuring the other as moving with speeds ±''v'' are said to be in ''standard configuration'', when:
* The ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' axes of frame S are oriented parallel to the respective primed axes of frame S′.
* Frame S′ moves in the ''x''-direction of frame S with a constant velocity ''v'' as measured in frame S.
* The origins of frames S and S′ coincide for time ''t'' = 0 in frame S and ''t''′ = 0 in frame S′.&lt;ref name="Collier"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Most Incomprehensible Thing: Notes Towards a Very Gentle Introduction to the Mathematics of Relativity|last1=Collier|first1=Peter|publisher=Incomprehensible Books|year=2017|isbn=9780957389465|edition=3rd|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|107}}

This spatial setting is displayed in the accompanying figure, in which the temporal coordinates are separately annotated as quantities ''t'' and ''t'''.

In a further step of simplification it is often possible to consider just the direction of the observed motion and ignore the other two spatial components, allowing ''x'' and ''ct'' to be plotted in 2-dimensional spacetime diagrams, as introduced above.

=== Non-relativistic "spacetime diagrams" ===
[[File:Minkowski diagram - Newtonian physics.svg|thumb|right|256px|In Newtonian physics for both observers the event at A is assigned to the same point in time.]]
The black axes labelled {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''ct''}} on the adjoining diagram are the coordinate system of an observer, referred to as 'at rest', and who is positioned at {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 0}}. This observer's world line is identical with the {{math|''ct''}} time axis. Each parallel line to this axis would correspond also to an object at rest but at another position. The blue line describes an object moving with constant speed {{math|''v''}} to the right, such as a moving observer.

This blue line labelled {{math|''ct''′}} may be interpreted as the time axis for the second observer. Together with the {{math|''x''}} axis, which is identical for both observers, it represents their coordinate system. Since the reference frames are in standard configuration, both observers agree on the location of the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] of their coordinate systems. The axes for the moving observer are not [[perpendicular]] to each other and the scale on their time axis is stretched. To determine the coordinates of a certain event, two lines, each parallel to one of the two axes, must be constructed passing through the event, and their intersections with the axes read off.

Determining position and time of the event A as an example in the diagram leads to the same time for both observers, as expected. Only for the position different values result, because the moving observer has approached the position of the event A since {{math|1=''t'' =  0}}. Generally stated, all events on a line parallel to the {{math|''x''}} axis happen simultaneously for both observers. There is only one universal time {{nowrap|1=''t'' = ''t''′}}, modelling the existence of one common position axis. On the other hand, due to two different time axes the observers usually measure different coordinates for the same event. This graphical translation from {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''t''}} to {{math|''x''′}} and {{math|''t''′}} and vice versa is described mathematically by the so-called [[Galilean transformation]].

== Minkowski diagrams ==

=== Overview ===
[[File:Minkowski diagram - asymmetric.svg|thumb|right|256px|In the theory of relativity each observer assigns the event at A to a different time and location.]]

[[File:MinkBoost2.gif|thumb|right|256px|Minkowski diagram for various speeds of the primed frame, which is moving relative to the unprimed frame. The dashed lines represent the [[light cone]] of a flash of light at the origin.]]

The term Minkowski diagram refers to a specific form of spacetime diagram frequently used in special relativity.  A Minkowski diagram is a two-dimensional graphical depiction of a portion of [[Minkowski space]], usually where space has been curtailed to a single dimension. The units of measurement in these diagrams are taken such that the [[light cone]] at an event consists of the lines of [[slope]] plus or minus one through that event.&lt;ref&gt;Mermin (1968) Chapter 17&lt;/ref&gt; The horizontal lines correspond to the usual notion of ''simultaneous events'' for a stationary observer at the origin.

A particular Minkowski diagram illustrates the result of a [[Lorentz transformation]]. The Lorentz transformation relates two [[inertial frames of reference]], where an [[observer (special relativity)|observer]] stationary at the event {{nowrap|(0, 0)}} makes a change of [[velocity]] along the {{math|''x''}}-axis. The new time axis of the observer forms an angle {{math|''α''}} with the previous time axis, with {{math|''α'' &lt; {{sfrac|π|4}}}}. In the new frame of reference the simultaneous events lie parallel to a line inclined by {{math|''α''}} to the previous lines of simultaneity. This is the new {{math|''x''}}-axis. Both the original set of axes and the primed set of axes have the property that they are orthogonal with respect to the [[Minkowski inner product]] or ''relativistic dot product''.

Whatever the magnitude of {{mvar|α}}, the line {{nowrap|1=''t'' = ''x''}} forms the universal&lt;ref&gt;See [[Vladimir Karapetoff]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bisection|bisector]].

The space and time [[units of measurement]] on the axes may, for example, be taken as one of the following pairs:
* Units of ~30 centimetres length and [[nanosecond]]s
* [[Astronomical unit]]s and intervals of about 8 minutes and 19 seconds (499 seconds)
* [[Light year]]s and [[year]]s
* [[Light-second]] and second

This way, light paths are represented by lines parallel to the bisector between the axes.

=== Mathematical details ===

The angle {{math|''α''}} between the {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''x''′}} axes will be identical with that between the time axes {{math|''ct''}} and {{math|''ct''′}}. This follows from the second postulate of special relativity, which says that the speed of light is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion (see below). The angle {{math|''α''}} is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mechanics and Thermodynamics |edition=illustrated |first1=Wolfgang |last1=Demtröder |publisher=Springer |year=2016 |isbn=978-3-319-27877-3 |pages=92–93 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TWUSDgAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=TWUSDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93 Extract of page 93]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tan\alpha=\frac{v}{c}=\beta.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:MinkScale.svg|thumb|right|256px|Different scales on the axes.]]
The corresponding boost from {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''t''}} to {{math|''x''′}} and {{math|''t''′}} and vice versa is described mathematically by the [[Lorentz transformation]], which can be written

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
ct' &amp; = \gamma (ct-\beta x),\\
x' &amp; = \gamma (x-vt) \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma = (1-\beta^2)^{-1/2}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lorentz factor]]. By applying the Lorentz transformation, the spacetime axes obtained for a boosted frame will always correspond to  [[conjugate diameters]] of a pair of [[hyperbola]]s. 

In a Minkowski diagram, the boosted and unboosted spacetime axes will in general have unequal unit lengths. If {{math|''U''}} is the unit length on the axes of {{math|''ct''}} and {{math|''x''}} respectively, the unit length on the axes of {{math|''ct''′}} and {{math|''x''′}} is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jürgen |last=Freund |title=Special Relativity for Beginners: A Textbook for Undergraduates |publisher=World Scientific| year=2008 |pages=49|isbn=978-9812771599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;U'=U\sqrt\frac{1+\beta^2}{1-\beta^2}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The {{math|''ct''}}-axis represents the worldline of a clock resting in {{math|''S''}}, with {{math|''U''}} representing the duration between two events happening on this worldline, also called the [[proper time]] between these events. Length {{math|''U''}} upon the {{math|''x''}}-axis represents the rest length or [[proper length]] of a rod resting in {{math|''S''}}. The same interpretation can also be applied to distance {{math|''U''′}} upon the {{math|''ct''′}}- and {{math|''x''′}}-axes for clocks and rods resting in {{math|''S''′}}.

In Minkowski's 1908 paper there were three diagrams, first to illustrate the Lorentz transformation, then the partition of the plane by the light-cone, and finally illustration of worldlines.&lt;ref name=minko /&gt; The first diagram used a branch of the [[unit hyperbola]] &lt;math&gt; t^2 - x^2 = 1 &lt;/math&gt; to show the locus of a unit of [[proper time]] depending on velocity, thus illustrating time dilation. The second diagram showed the conjugate hyperbola to calibrate space, where a similar stretching leaves the impression of [[FitzGerald contraction]]. In 1914 [[Ludwik Silberstein]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Silberstein |first=Ludwik |date=1914 |title=The Theory of Relativity |url=https://archive.org/details/theoryofrelativi00silbrich |page=[https://archive.org/details/theoryofrelativi00silbrich/page/131 131]}}&lt;/ref&gt; included a diagram of "Minkowski’s representation of the Lorentz transformation". This diagram included the unit hyperbola, its conjugate, and a pair of [[conjugate diameters]]. Since the 1960s a version of this more complete configuration has been referred to as The Minkowski Diagram, and used as a standard illustration of the [[transformation geometry]] of special relativity. [[E. T. Whittaker]] has pointed out that the [[principle of relativity]] is tantamount to the arbitrariness of what hyperbola radius is selected for [[time]] in the Minkowski diagram. In 1912 [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and [[Edwin B. Wilson]] applied the methods of [[synthetic geometry]] to develop the properties of the [[non-Euclidean]] plane that has Minkowski diagrams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Edwin B.|last=Wilson|author1-link=Edwin B. Wilson|first2=Gilbert N.|last2=Lewis|author2-link=Gilbert N. Lewis|date=1912|title=The Space-time Manifold of Relativity. The Non-Euclidean Geometry of Mechanics and Electromagnetics|journal=Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences|volume=48|pages=387–507}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5koAax8ct?url=http://ca.geocities.com/cocklebio/synsptm.html Synthetic Spacetime], a digest of the axioms used, and theorems proved, by Wilson and Lewis. Archived by [[WebCite]]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Taylor and Wheeler composed ''Spacetime Physics'' (1966), they did ''not'' use the term "Minkowski diagram" for their spacetime geometry. Instead they included an acknowledgement of Minkowski's contribution to philosophy by the totality of his innovation of 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor |last2=Wheeler |title=Spacetime Physics |url=https://archive.org/details/spacetimephysics0000tayl |url-access=registration |date=1966 |page=[https://archive.org/details/spacetimephysics0000tayl/page/37 37] |quote=Minkowski's insight is central to the understanding of the physical world. It focuses attention on those quantities, such as interval, which are the same in all frames of reference. It brings out the relative character of quantities, such as velocity, energy, time, distance, which depend on the frame of reference.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Loedel diagrams ==

While a frame at rest in a Minkowski diagram has orthogonal spacetime axes, a frame moving relative to the rest frame in a Minkowski diagram has spacetime axes which form an acute angle. This asymmetry of Minkowski diagrams can be misleading, since [[special relativity]] postulates that any two [[inertial reference frames]] must be physically equivalent. The Loedel diagram is an alternative spacetime diagram that makes the symmetry of inertial references frames much more manifest.

Several authors showed that there is a frame of reference between the resting and moving ones where their symmetry would be apparent ("median frame").&lt;ref name=mirimanoff /&gt; In this frame, the two other frames are moving in opposite directions with equal speed. Using such coordinates makes the units of length and time the same for both axes. If {{math|''β'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''v''|''c''}}}} and {{math|''γ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|{{sqrt|1 − ''β''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}}} is given between &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S^\prime&lt;/math&gt;, then these expressions are connected with the values in their median frame S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; as follows:&lt;ref name=mirimanoff&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mirimanoff|first=Dmitry|title=La transformation de Lorentz-Einstein et le temps universel de M. Ed. Guillaume|journal=Archives des sciences physiques et naturelles (supplement) |series=5|volume=3|pages=46–48|year=1921|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2991536/f682.image}} (Translation: [[s:en:Translation:The Lorentz-Einstein transformation and the universal time of Ed.

(2) &amp;  &amp; \beta_{0} &amp; =\frac{\gamma-1}{\beta\gamma}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, if {{math|''β'' {{=}} 0.5}} between &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S^\prime&lt;/math&gt;, then by (2) they are moving in their median frame S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; with approximately {{math|±0.268''c''}} each in opposite directions. On the other hand, if {{math|''β''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0.5}} in S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, then by (1) the relative velocity between &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S^\prime&lt;/math&gt; in their own rest frames is {{math|0.8''c''}}. The construction of the axes of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S^\prime&lt;/math&gt; is done in accordance with the ordinary method using {{math|tan ''α'' {{=}} ''β''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} with respect to the orthogonal axes of the median frame (Fig. 1).

However, it turns out that when drawing such a symmetric diagram, it is possible to derive the diagram's relations even without mentioning the median frame and {{math|''β''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} at all. Instead, the relative velocity {{math|''β'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''v''|''c''}}}} between &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S^\prime&lt;/math&gt; can directly be used in the following construction, providing the same result:&lt;ref name=sartori&gt;{{cite book |first=Leo |last=Sartori  |title=Understanding Relativity: A simplified approach to Einstein's theories |isbn=0-520-20029-2 |publisher=University of California Press |year=1996|pages=151ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

If {{math|''φ''}} is the angle between the axes of {{math|''ct''′}} and {{math|''ct''}} (or between {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''x''′}}), and {{math|''θ''}} between the axes of {{math|''x''′}} and {{math|''ct''′}}, it is given:&lt;ref name=sartori /&gt;&lt;ref name=gruner1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gruner2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=shado /&gt;

\sin\varphi=\cos\theta &amp; =\beta,\\
\cos\varphi=\sin\theta &amp; =\frac{1}{\gamma},\\
\tan\varphi=\cot\theta &amp; =\beta\cdot\gamma.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Two methods of construction are obvious from Fig. 2: (a) The {{math|''x''}}-axis is drawn perpendicular to the {{math|''ct''′}}-axis, the {{math|''x''′}} and {{math|''ct''}}-axes are added at angle {{math|''φ''}}; (b) the ''x''′-axis is drawn at angle {{math|''θ''}} with respect to the {{math|''ct''′}}-axis, the {{math|''x''}}-axis is added perpendicular to the {{math|''ct''′}}-axis and the {{math|''ct''}}-axis perpendicular to the {{math|''x''′}}-axis.

In a Minkowski diagram, lengths on the page cannot be directly compared to each other, due to warping factor between the axes' unit lengths in a Minkowski diagram. In particular, if &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U^\prime&lt;/math&gt; are the unit lengths of the rest frame axes and moving frame axes, respectively, in a Minkowski diagram, then the two unit lengths are warped relative to each other via the formula: 

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
U^\prime&amp;=U\sqrt\frac{1+\beta^2}{1-\beta^2}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

By contrast, in a symmetric Loedel diagram, both the &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S^\prime&lt;/math&gt; frame axes are warped by the same factor relative to the median frame and hence have identical unit lengths. This implies that, for a Loedel spacetime diagram, we can directly compare spacetime lengths between different frames as they appear on the page; no unit length scaling/conversion between frames is necessary due to the symmetric nature of the Loedel diagram.

=== History ===
*[[Max Born]] (1920) drew Minkowski diagrams by placing the {{math|''ct''′}}-axis almost perpendicular to the {{math|''x''}}-axis, as well as the {{math|''ct''}}-axis to the {{math|''x''′}}-axis, in order to demonstrate length contraction and time dilation in the symmetric case of two rods and two clocks moving in opposite direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Born|first=Max|title=Die Relativitätstheorie Einsteins|trans-title=Einstein's Theory of Relativity|location=|pages=177–180|publisher=Springer|year=1920|edition=First|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006663730}} See also [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=de_6AAAAQBAJ|page=187}} Reprint (2013) of third edition (1922) at Google books, p. 187]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dmitry Mirimanoff]] (1921) showed that there is always a median frame with respect to two relatively moving frames, and derived the relations between them from the Lorentz transformation. However, he didn't give a graphical representation in a diagram.&lt;ref name=mirimanoff /&gt;
* Symmetric diagrams were systematically developed by [[Paul Gruner]] in collaboration with Josef Sauter in two papers in 1921.

== Relativistic phenomena in diagrams ==

=== Time dilation ===

[[File:LoedelTD.png|thumb|right|400px|Relativistic time dilation, as depicted in two Loedel spacetime diagrams. Both observers consider the clock of the other as running slower.]]

[[File:Minkowski diagram - time dilation.svg|thumb|right|256px|Relativistic time dilation, as depicted in a single Loedel spacetime diagram. Both observers consider the clock of the other as running slower.]]

Relativistic time dilation refers to the fact that a clock (indicating its [[proper time]] in its rest frame) that moves relative to an observer is observed to run slower. The situation is depicted in symmetric Loedel diagrams to the right. Note that we can compare spacetime lengths on page directly with each other, due to the symmetric nature of the Loedel diagram.

The observer whose reference frame is given by the black axes is assumed to move from the origin O towards A. The moving clock has the reference frame given by the blue axes and moves from O to B. For the black observer, all events happening simultaneously with the event at A are located on a straight line parallel to its space axis. This line passes through A and B, so A and B are simultaneous from the reference frame of the observer with black axes. However, the clock that is moving relative to the black observer marks off time along the blue time axis. This is represented by the distance from O to B. Therefore, the observer at A with the black axes notices their clock as reading the distance from O to A while they observe the clock moving relative him or her to read the distance from O to B. Due to the distance from O to B being smaller than the distance from O to A, they conclude that the time passed on the clock moving relative to them is smaller than that passed on their own clock.

A second observer, having moved together with the clock from O to B, will argue that the other clock has reached only C until this moment and therefore this clock runs slower. The reason for these apparently paradoxical statements is the different determination of the events happening synchronously at different locations. Due to the principle of relativity, the question of who is right has no answer and does not make sense.

=== Length contraction ===

[[File:LoedelLC2.png|thumb|right|400px|Relativistic length contraction, as depicted in two Loedel spacetime diagrams. Both observers consider objects moving with the other observer as being shorter.]]

[[File:Minkowski diagram - length contraction.svg|thumb|right|256px|Relativistic length contraction, as depicted in a single Loedel spacetime diagram. Both observers consider objects moving with the other observer as being shorter.]]

Relativistic length contraction refers to the fact that a ruler (indicating its [[proper length]] in its rest frame) that moves relative to an observer is observed to contract/shorten. The situation is depicted in symmetric Loedel diagrams to the right. Note that we can compare spacetime lengths on page directly with each other, due to the symmetric nature of the Loedel diagram.

The observer is assumed again to move along the {{math|''ct''}}-axis. The world lines of the endpoints of an object moving relative to him are assumed to move along the {{math|''ct''′}}-axis and the parallel line passing through A and B. For this observer the endpoints of the object at {{nowrap|1=''t'' = 0}} are O and A. For a second observer moving together with the object, so that for him the object is at rest, it has the proper length OB at {{nowrap|1=''t''′ = 0}}. Due to {{nowrap|OA &lt; OB}}. the object is contracted for the first observer.

The second observer will argue that the first observer has evaluated the endpoints of the object at O and A respectively and therefore at different times, leading to a wrong result due to his motion in the meantime. If the second observer investigates the length of another object with endpoints moving along the {{math|''ct''}}-axis and a parallel line passing through C and D he concludes the same way this object to be contracted from OD to OC. Each observer estimates objects moving with the other observer to be contracted. This apparently paradoxical situation is again a consequence of the relativity of simultaneity as demonstrated by the analysis via Minkowski diagram.

For all these considerations it was assumed, that both observers take into account the speed of light and their distance to all events they see in order to determine the actual times at which these events happen from their point of view.

=== Constancy of the speed of light ===
[[File:Minkowski diagram - 3 systems.svg|thumb|right|256px|Minkowski diagram for 3 coordinate systems. For the speeds relative to the system in black {{math|1=''v''′ = 0.4''c''}} and {{math|1=''v''″ = 0.8''c''}} holds.]] Another postulate of special relativity is the constancy of the speed of light. It says that any observer in an inertial reference frame measuring the vacuum speed of light relative to themself obtains the same value regardless of his own motion and that of the light source. This statement seems to be paradoxical, but it follows immediately from the differential equation yielding this, and the Minkowski diagram agrees. It explains also the result of the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] which was considered to be a mystery before the theory of relativity was discovered, when photons were thought to be waves through an undetectable medium.

For world lines of photons passing the origin in different directions {{math|1=''x'' = ''ct''}} and {{math|1=''x'' = −''ct''}} holds. That means any position on such a world line corresponds with steps on {{math|''x''}}- and {{math|''ct''}}-axes of equal absolute value. From the rule for reading off coordinates in coordinate system with tilted axes follows that the two world lines are the angle bisectors of the {{math|''x''}}- and {{math|''ct''}}-axes. The Minkowski diagram shows, that they are angle bisectors of the {{math|''x′''}}- and {{math|''ct''′}}-axes as well. That means both observers measure the same speed {{math|''c''}} for both photons.

Further coordinate systems corresponding to observers with arbitrary velocities can be added to this Minkowski diagram. For all these systems both photon world lines represent the angle bisectors of the axes. The more the relative speed approaches the speed of light the more the axes approach the corresponding angle bisector. The &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis is always more flat and the time axis more steep than the photon world lines. The scales on both axes are always identical, but usually different from those of the other coordinate systems.

=== Speed of light and causality ===
[[File:Minkowski diagram - causality.svg|thumb|right|256px|Past and future relative to the origin. For the grey areas a corresponding temporal classification is not possible.]]
Straight lines passing the origin which are steeper than both photon world lines correspond with objects moving more slowly than the speed of light. If this applies to an object, then it applies from the viewpoint of all observers, because the world lines of these photons are the angle bisectors for any inertial reference frame. Therefore, any point above the origin and between the world lines of both photons can be reached with a speed smaller than that of the light and can have a cause-and-effect relationship with the origin. This area is the absolute future, because any event there happens later compared to the event represented by the origin regardless of the observer, which is obvious graphically from the Minkowski diagram.

Following the same argument the range below the origin and between the photon world lines is the absolute past relative to the origin. Any event there belongs definitely to the past and can be the cause of an effect at the origin.

The relationship between any such pairs of event is called ''timelike'', because they have a time distance greater than zero for all observers. A straight line connecting these two events is always the time axis of a possible observer for whom they happen at the same place. Two events which can be connected just with the speed of light are called ''lightlike''.

In principle a further dimension of space can be added to the Minkowski diagram leading to a three-dimensional representation. In this case the ranges of future and past become [[cone (geometry)|cone]]s with apexes touching each other at the origin. They are called [[light cones]].
{{clear}}

=== The speed of light as a limit ===
[[File:Minkowski diagram - time travel.svg|thumb|right|256px|Sending a message at superluminal speed from O via A to B into the past. Both observers consider the temporal order of the pairs of events O and A as well as A and B different.]]
Following the same argument, all straight lines passing through the origin and which are more nearly horizontal than the photon world lines, would correspond to objects or signals moving [[Faster-than-light|faster than light]] regardless of the speed of the observer. Therefore, no event outside the light cones can be reached from the origin, even by a light-signal, nor by any object or signal moving with less than the speed of light. Such pairs of events are called ''spacelike'' because they have a finite spatial distance different from zero for all observers. On the other hand, a straight line connecting such events is always the space coordinate axis of a possible observer for whom they happen at the same time. By a slight variation of the velocity of this coordinate system in both directions it is always possible to find two inertial reference frames whose observers estimate the chronological order of these events to be different.

Therefore, an object moving faster than light, say from O to A in the adjoining diagram, would imply that, for any observer watching the object moving from O to A, another observer can be found (moving at less than the speed of light with respect to the first) for whom the object moves from A to O. The question of which observer is right has no unique answer, and therefore makes no physical sense. Any such moving object or signal would violate the principle of causality.

Also, any general technical means of sending signals faster than light would permit information to be sent into the originator's own past. In the diagram, an observer at O in the {{math|''x''-''ct''}} system sends a message moving faster than light to A. At A, it is received by another observer, moving so as to be in the {{math|''x''′-''ct''′}} system, who sends it back, again faster than light, arriving at B. But B is in the past relative to O. The absurdity of this process becomes obvious when both observers subsequently confirm that they received no message at all, but all messages were directed towards the other observer as can be seen graphically in the Minkowski diagram. Furthermore, if it were possible to accelerate an observer to the speed of light, their space and time axes would coincide with their angle bisector. The coordinate system would collapse, in concordance with the fact that due to [[time dilation]], time would effectively stop passing for them.

These considerations show that the speed of light as a limit is a consequence of the properties of spacetime, and not of the properties of objects such as technologically imperfect space ships. The prohibition of faster-than-light motion, therefore, has nothing in particular to do with electromagnetic waves or light, but comes as a consequence of the structure of spacetime.

==Accelerating observers==

[[File:Lorentz transform of world line.gif|right|framed|The momentarily co-moving inertial frames along the world line of a rapidly accelerating observer (center).]]

In the animation to the right, the vertical direction indicates time while the horizontal indicates distance. The dashed line is the world line of an accelerating observer, and the small dots are specific events in spacetime. 

If one imagines each event to be the flashing of a light, then the events that pass the two diagonal lines in the bottom half of the image (the past light cone of the observer in the origin) are the events visible to the observer. The slope of the world line (deviation from being vertical) gives the relative velocity to the observer. Note how the momentarily co-moving inertial frame changes when the observer accelerates.

      <text bytes="2178" xml:space="preserve">A '''partial linear space''' (also '''semilinear''' or '''near-linear''' space) is a basic [[incidence structure]] in the field of incidence geometry, that carries slightly less structure than a [[linear space (geometry)|linear space]].
The notion is equivalent to that of a linear [[hypergraph]].
==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;S=({\mathcal P},{\mathcal B}, \textbf{I}) &lt;/math&gt; an incidence structure, for which the elements of &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal P}&lt;/math&gt; are called ''points'' and the elements of &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal B}&lt;/math&gt; are called ''lines''. ''S'' is a partial linear space, if the following axioms hold:
* any line is incident with at least two points
* any pair of distinct points is incident with at most one line

If there is a unique line incident with every pair of distinct points, then we get a linear space. 

==Properties==
The [[De Bruijn–Erdős theorem (incidence geometry)]] shows that in any finite linear space &lt;math&gt;S=({\mathcal P},{\mathcal B}, \textbf{I})&lt;/math&gt; which is not a single point or a single line, we have &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal{P}| \leq |\mathcal{L}|&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Geometry processing''', or [[polygon mesh|mesh]] processing, is an area of research that uses concepts from [[applied mathematics]], [[computer science]] and [[engineering]] to design efficient [[algorithm]]s for the acquisition, [[3D reconstruction|reconstruction]], analysis, manipulation, simulation and transmission of complex 3D models.  As the name implies, many of the concepts, data structures, and algorithms are directly analogous to [[signal processing]] and [[image processing]]. For example, where [[image smoothing]] might convolve an intensity signal with a blur kernel formed using the [[Laplace operator]], [[Laplacian smoothing|geometric smoothing]] might be achieved by convolving a [[Surface (mathematics)|surface]] geometry with a blur kernel formed using the [[Laplace-Beltrami operator]].

Applications of geometry processing algorithms already cover a wide range of areas from [[multimedia]], [[entertainment]] and classical [[computer-aided design]], to biomedical computing, [[reverse engineering]], and [[scientific computing]].&lt;ref name=PMP2010&gt;

Geometry processing is a common research topic at [[SIGGRAPH]], the premier [[computer graphics]] academic conference, and the main topic of the annual [[Symposium on Geometry Processing]].

== Geometry processing as a life cycle ==
[[File:Cactus Gaussian Curvature.png|thumb|A mesh of a cactus showing the Gaussian Curvature at each vertex, using the angle defect method.]]

Geometry processing involves working with a [[shape]], usually in 2D or 3D, although the shape can live in a space of arbitrary dimensions. The processing of a shape involves three stages, which is known as its life cycle. At its "birth," a shape can be instantiated through one of three methods: a [[3D modeling|model]], a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical representation]], or a [[3D scanner|scan]]. After a shape is born, it can be analyzed and edited repeatedly in a cycle. This usually involves acquiring different measurements, such as the distances between the points of the shape, the smoothness of the shape, or its [[Euler characteristic]]. Editing may involve denoising, deforming, or performing [[rigid transformation]]s. At the final stage of the shape's "life," it is consumed. This can mean it is consumed by a viewer as a rendered asset in a game or movie, for instance. The end of a shape's life can also be defined by a decision about the shape, like whether or not it satisfies some criteria. Or it can even be [[Digital modeling and fabrication|fabricated]] in the real world, through a method such as 3D printing or laser cutting.

== Discrete Representation of a Shape ==
Like any other shape, the shapes used in geometry processing have properties pertaining to their [[geometry]] and [[topology]]. The geometry of a shape concerns the position of the shape's [[Euclidean space|points in space]], [[tangent]]s, [[Normal (geometry)|normals]], and [[curvature]]. It also includes the dimension in which the shape lives (ex. &lt;math&gt;R^2&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;R^3&lt;/math&gt;). The [[topology]] of a shape is a collection of properties that do not change even after smooth transformations have been applied to the shape. It concerns dimensions such as the number of [[Holes (topology)|holes]] and [[Boundary (topology)|boundaries]], as well as the [[orientability]] of the shape. One example of a non-orientable shape is the [[Möbius strip|Mobius strip]].

In computers, everything must be discretized. Shapes in geometry processing are usually represented as [[triangle mesh]]es, which can be seen as a [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]. Each node in the graph is a vertex (usually in &lt;math&gt;R^3&lt;/math&gt;), which has a position. This encodes the geometry of the shape. Directed edges connect these vertices into triangles, which by the right hand rule, then have a direction called the normal. Each triangle forms a face of the mesh. These are combinatoric in nature and encode the topology of the shape. In addition to triangles, a more general class of [[polygon mesh]]es can also be used to represent a shape. More advanced representations like [[progressive meshes]] encode a coarse representation along with a sequence of transformations, which produce a fine or high resolution representation of the shape once applied. These meshes are useful in a variety of applications, including geomorphs, progressive transmission, mesh compression, and selective refinement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hhoppe.com/pm.pdf|title=Progressive Meshes|author=Hugues Hoppe}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mesh bunny.png|left|thumb|274x274px|A mesh of the famous Stanford bunny. Shapes are usually represented as a mesh, a collection of polygons that delineate the contours of the shape.]]

=== Properties of a shape ===
==== Euler Characteristic ====
One particularly important property of a 3D shape is its [[Euler characteristic]], which can alternatively be defined in terms of its [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]]. The formula for this in the continuous sense is &lt;math&gt;\chi= 2c - 2h - b&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the number of connected components, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is number of holes (as in donut holes, see [[torus]]), and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the number of connected components of the boundary of the surface. A concrete example of this is a mesh of a [[Pair of pants (mathematics)|pair of pants]]. There is one connected component, 0 holes, and 3 connected components of the boundary (the waist and two leg holes). So in this case, the Euler characteristic is -1. To bring this into the discrete world, the Euler characteristic of a mesh is computed in terms of its vertices, edges, and faces. &lt;math&gt;\chi = |V| - |E| + |F|&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Pants mesh.png|thumb|This image shows a mesh of a pair of pants, with Euler characteristic -1. This is explained by the equation to compute the characteristic: 2c - 2h - b. The mesh has 1 connected component, 0 topological holes, and 3 boundaries (the waist hole and each leg hole): 2 - 0 - 3 = -1.]]

== Surface reconstruction ==
=== Poisson reconstruction from surface points to mesh ===
[[File:Mesh reconstruction.gif|thumb|339x339px|A triangle mesh is constructed out of a [[point cloud]]. Sometimes shapes are initialized only as "point clouds," a collection of sampled points from the shape's surface. Often, these point clouds need to be converted to meshes.|left]]
Depending on how a shape is initialized or "birthed," the shape might exist only as a nebula of sampled points that represent its surface in space. To transform the surface points into a mesh, the Poisson reconstruction&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hhoppe.com/proj/poissonrecon/|title=Poisson surface reconstruction|website=hhoppe.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; strategy can be employed. This method states that the [[indicator function]], a function that determines which points in space belong to the surface of the shape, can actually be computed from the sampled points. The key concept is that gradient of the indicator function is ''0'' everywhere, except at the sampled points, where it is equal to the inward surface normal. More formally, suppose the collection of sampled points from the surface is denoted by &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, each point in the space by &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;, and the corresponding normal at that point by &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt;. Then the gradient of the indicator function is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;\triangledown g = \begin{cases} \textbf{n}_i, &amp; \forall p_i \in S \\ 0, &amp; \text{otherwise}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The task of reconstruction then becomes a [[Calculus of variations|variational]] problem. To find the indicator function of the surface, we must find a function &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\lVert \triangledown \chi - \textbf{V} \rVert&lt;/math&gt; is minimized, where &lt;math&gt;\textbf{V}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector field defined by the samples. As a variational problem, one can view the minimizer &lt;math&gt;\chi &lt;/math&gt;as a solution of [[Poisson's equation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After obtaining a good approximation for &lt;math&gt;\chi &lt;/math&gt; and a value &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;  for which the points &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\chi(x,y,z)= \sigma&lt;/math&gt; lie on the surface to be reconstructed, the [[marching cubes]] algorithm can be used to construct a [[triangle mesh]] from the function  &lt;math&gt;\chi &lt;/math&gt; , which can then be applied in subsequent computer graphics applications.

One common problem encountered in geometry processing is how to merge multiple views of a single object captured from different angles or positions. This problem is known as [[Point set registration|registration]]. In registration, we wish to find an optimal [[rigid transformation]] that will align surface &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with surface &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. More formally, if &lt;math&gt;P_Y(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the projection of a point ''x'' from surface &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; onto surface &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, we want to find the optimal rotation matrix &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and translation vector &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; that minimize the following objective function:

&lt;math&gt;\int_{x \in X}||Rx + t - P_Y(x)|| dx&lt;/math&gt;

While rotations are non-linear in general, small rotations can be linearized as skew-symmetric matrices. Moreover, the distance function &lt;math&gt;x - P_Y(x)&lt;/math&gt; is non-linear, but is amenable to linear approximations if the change in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is small. An iterative solution such as [[Iterative closest point|Iterative Closest Point (ICP)]] is therefore employed to solve for small transformations iteratively, instead of solving for the potentially large transformation in one go. In ICP, ''n'' random sample points from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; are chosen and projected onto &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. In order to sample points uniformly at random across the surface of the triangle mesh, the random sampling is broken into two stages: uniformly sampling points within a triangle; and non-uniformly sampling triangles, such that each triangle's associated probability is proportional to its surface area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcl-users.org/file/n4037867/Rusinkiewicz_Effcient_Variants_of_ICP.pdf|title=Efficient Variants of the ICP Algorithm|author=Szymon Rusinkiewicz, Marc Levoy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the optimal transformation is calculated based on the difference between each &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and its projection. In the following iteration, the projections are calculated based on the result of applying the previous transformation on the samples. The process is repeated until convergence.

== Smoothing ==
When shapes are defined or scanned, there may be accompanying noise, either to a signal acting upon the surface or to the actual surface geometry. Reducing noise on the former is known as [[Noise reduction|data denoising]], while noise reduction on the latter is known as [[surface fairing]]. The task of geometric smoothing is analogous to signal noise reduction, and consequently employs similar approaches.

The pertinent Lagrangian to be minimized is derived by recording the conformity to the initial signal &lt;math&gt;\bar f&lt;/math&gt; and the smoothness of the resulting signal, which approximated by the magnitude of the gradient with a weight &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(f) = \int_{\Omega}\|f - \bar f\|^2 + \lambda \|\nabla f\|^2 dx&lt;/math&gt;.

Taking a variation &lt;math&gt;\delta f&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; emits the necessary condition

&lt;math&gt;0 = \delta\mathcal{L}(f) = \int_{\Omega}\delta f(\mathbf{I} + \lambda \nabla^2) f - \delta f \bar f dx&lt;/math&gt;.

By discretizing this onto piecewise-constant elements with our signal on the vertices we obtain

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sum_{i} M_i \delta f_i \bar f_i &amp;=  \sum_i M_i\delta f_i \sum_j (\mathbf{I} + \lambda \nabla^2) f_j =  \sum_i \delta f_i \sum_j (M + \lambda M\nabla^2) f_j,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;[[File:Noisy sphere.gif|thumb|A noisy sphere being iteratively smoothed.|273x273px|left]]where our choice of &lt;math&gt;\nabla^2&lt;/math&gt; is chosen to be &lt;math&gt;M^{-1}\mathbf{L}&lt;/math&gt; for the cotangent Laplacian &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;M^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; term is to map the image of the Laplacian from areas to points. Because the variation is free, this results in a self-adjoint linear problem to solve with a parameter &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;
\bar f =(M + \lambda \mathbf{L}) f.
&lt;/math&gt; When working with triangle meshes one way to determine the values of the Laplacian matrix &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is through analyzing the geometry of connected triangles on the mesh.

&lt;math&gt;
L_{ij} =  
\begin{cases} 
      \frac{1}{2}(\cot(\alpha_{ij}) + \cot(\beta_{ij})) &amp; \text{edge ij exists} \\
      -\sum\limits_{i \neq j}L_{ij} &amp; i = j  \\
      0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
     
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are the angles opposite the edge &lt;math&gt;(i,j)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ctralie.com/Teaching/LapMesh/|title=Chris Tralie : Laplacian Meshes|website=www.ctralie.com|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[mass matrix]] M as an operator computes the local integral of a function's value and is often set for a mesh with m triangles as follows:

&lt;math&gt;
M_{ij} =  
\begin{cases} 
      \frac{1}{3}\sum\limits_{t=1}^m\begin{cases}
Area(t) &amp; \text{if triangle t contains vertex i} \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases} &amp; \text{if i=j} \\
      0 &amp; \text{otherwise} 
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Parameterization ==
Occasionally, we need to flatten a 3D surface onto a flat plane. This process is known as [[Mesh parameterization|parameterization]]. The goal is to find coordinates ''u'' and ''v'' onto which we can map the surface so that distortions are minimized. In this manner, parameterization can be seen as an optimization problem. One of the major applications of mesh parameterization is [[texture mapping]].

=== Mass springs method ===
[[File:Tutte Embedding on Beetle.gif|thumb|378x378px|The Tutte Embedding shows non-smooth parameterizations on the side of the beetle.]]
One way to measure the distortion accrued in the mapping process is to measure how much the length of the edges on the 2D mapping differs from their lengths in the original 3D surface. In more formal terms, the objective function can be written as:

&lt;math&gt;\underset{U}{\text{min}} \sum_{ij \in E} ||u_i - u_j||^2&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the set of mesh edges and &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is the set of vertices. However, optimizing this objective function would result in a solution that maps all of the vertices to a single vertex in the ''uv''-coordinates. Borrowing an idea from graph theory, we apply the [[Tutte embedding|Tutte Mapping]] and restrict the boundary vertices of the mesh onto a unit circle or other [[convex polygon]]. Doing so prevents the vertices from collapsing into a single vertex when the mapping is applied. The non-boundary vertices are then positioned at the [[Barycentric coordinate system|barycentric interpolation]] of their neighbours. The Tutte Mapping, however, still suffers from severe distortions as it attempts to make the edge lengths equal, and hence does not correctly account for the triangle sizes on the actual surface mesh.

=== Least-squares conformal mappings ===
[[File:Tutte Vs LSCM .gif|left|thumb|394x394px|A comparison of the Tutte Embedding and Least-Squares-Conformal-Mapping parameterization. Notice how the LSCM parameterization is smooth on the side of the beetle.]]
Another way to measure the distortion is to consider the [[Differential calculus|variations]] on the ''u'' and ''v'' coordinate functions. The wobbliness and distortion apparent in the mass springs methods are due to high variations in the ''u'' and ''v'' coordinate functions. With this approach, the objective function becomes the [[Dirichlet's energy|Dirichlet energy]] on ''u'' and ''v:''

&lt;math&gt;\underset{u,v}{\text{min}} \int_S ||\nabla u||^2 + ||\nabla v||^2 dA&lt;/math&gt;

There are a few other things to consider. We would like to minimize the angle distortion to [[Conformal map|preserve orthogonality]]. That means we would like &lt;math&gt;\nabla u = \nabla v^{\perp}&lt;/math&gt;. In addition, we would also like the mapping to have proportionally similar sized regions as the original. This results to setting the Jacobian of the ''u'' and ''v'' coordinate functions to 1.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
  \dfrac{\partial u}{\partial x} &amp; \dfrac{\partial u}{\partial y}\\[1em]
  \dfrac{\partial v}{\partial x} &amp; \dfrac{\partial v}{\partial y} \end{bmatrix}
= 1&lt;/math&gt;

Putting these requirements together, we can augment the Dirichlet energy so that our objective function becomes:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Desbrun|first=Mathieu|year=2002|title=Intrinsic Parameterizations of Surface Meshes|url=http://www.geometry.caltech.edu/pubs/DMA02.pdf|journal=Eurographics|volume=21|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levy|first=Bruno|year=2002|title=Least squares conformal maps for automatic texture atlas generation|url=https://members.loria.fr/Bruno.Levy/papers/LSCM_SIGGRAPH_2002.pdf|journal=ACM Transactions on Graphics |volume=21|issue=3|pages=362–371|via=|doi=10.1145/566654.566590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\underset{u,v}{\text{min}} \int_S \frac{1}{2} ||\nabla u||^2 + \frac{1}{2} ||\nabla v||^2 - \nabla u \cdot \nabla v^{\perp} &lt;/math&gt;

To avoid the problem of having all the vertices mapped to a single point, we also require that the solution to the optimization problem must have a non-zero norm and that it is orthogonal to the trivial solution.

== Deformation ==
[[File:Asrigidaspossible-man.gif|thumb|394x394px|An example of as-rigid-as-possible deformation.]]
Deformation is concerned with transforming some rest shape to a new shape. Typically, these transformations are continuous and do not alter the topology of the shape. Modern mesh-based shape deformation methods satisfy user deformation constraints at handles (selected vertices or regions on the mesh) and propagate these handle deformations to the rest of shape smoothly and without removing or distorting details. Some common forms of interactive deformations are point-based, skeleton-based, and cage-based.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Jacobson|first1=Alec|last2=Baran|first2=Ilya|last3=Popović|first3=Jovan|last4=[[Olga Sorkine-Hornung|Sorkine]]|first4=Olga|year=2011|title=Bounded Biharmonic Weights for Real-Time Deformation|url=https://igl.ethz.ch/projects/bbw/bounded-biharmonic-weights-siggraph-2011-jacobson-et-al.pdf|journal=ACM Transactions on Graphics|volume=30|issue=4|pages=1|doi=10.1145/2010324.1964973}}&lt;/ref&gt; In point-based deformation, a user can apply transformations to small set of points, called handles, on the shape. Skeleton-based deformation defines a [[skeleton]] for the shape, which allows a user to move the bones and rotate the joints. Cage-based deformation requires a cage to be drawn around all or part of a shape so that, when the user manipulates points on the cage, the volume it encloses changes accordingly.

=== Point-based deformation ===
Handles provide a sparse set of constraints for the deformation: as the user moves one point, the others must stay in place.

A rest surface &lt;math&gt;\hat{S}&lt;/math&gt; [[Immersion (mathematics)|immersed]] in &lt;math&gt;\R^3&lt;/math&gt; can be described with a mapping &lt;math&gt;\hat{x} : \Omega \rightarrow \R^3&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is a 2D parametric domain. The same can be done with another mapping &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; for the transformed surface &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. Ideally, the transformed shape adds as little distortion as possible to the original. One way to model this distortion is in terms of displacements &lt;math&gt;d = x - \hat{x}&lt;/math&gt; with a Laplacian-based energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marc|first=Alexa|year=2003|title=Differential coordinates for local mesh morphing and deformation|journal=The Visual Computer|volume=19|pages=105–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applying the Laplace operator to these mappings allows us to measure how the position of a point changes relative to its neighborhood, which keeps the handles smooth. Thus, the energy we would like to minimize can be written as:

&lt;math&gt;\min_{\textbf{d}} \int_{\Omega} || \Delta \textbf{d} ||^2 dA&lt;/math&gt;.

While this method is translation invariant, it is unable to account for rotations. The As-Rigid-As-Possible deformation scheme&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=[[Olga Sorkine-Hornung|Sorkine]]|first1=Olga|last2=Alexa|first2=Marc|year=2007|title=As-Rigid-As-Possible Surface Modeling|url=https://www.igl.ethz.ch/projects/ARAP/arap_web.pdf|journal=Proceedings of EUROGRAPHICS/ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Geometry Processing|pages=109–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; applies a rigid transformation &lt;math&gt;x_i = R\hat{x_i} + t&lt;/math&gt; to each handle i, where &lt;math&gt;R \in SO(3) \subset \R^3&lt;/math&gt; is a rotation matrix and &lt;math&gt;t \in \R^3&lt;/math&gt; is a translation vector. Unfortunately, there's no way to know the rotations in advance, so instead we pick a “best” rotation that minimizes displacements. To achieve local rotation invariance, however, requires a function &lt;math&gt;\textbf{R} : \Omega \rightarrow SO(3)&lt;/math&gt; which outputs the best rotation for every point on the surface. The resulting energy, then, must optimize over both &lt;math&gt;\textbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\min_{\textbf{x,R} \in SO(3)} \int_{\Omega} || \nabla \textbf{x} - \textbf{R} \nabla \hat{\textbf{x}} ||^2 dA&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the translation vector is not present in the final objective function because translations have constant gradient.

== Inside-Outside Segmentation ==
While seemingly trivial, in many cases, determining the inside from the outside of a triangle mesh is not an easy problem. In general, given a surface &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; we pose this problem as determining a function &lt;math&gt;isInside(q)&lt;/math&gt; which will return &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; if the point &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is inside &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; otherwise.

In the simplest case, the shape is closed. In this case, to determine if a point &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is inside or outside the surface, we can cast a ray &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; in any direction from a query point, and count the number of times &lt;math&gt;count_r&lt;/math&gt; it passes through the surface. If &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; was outside &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; then the ray must either not pass through &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; (in which case &lt;math&gt;count_r = 0&lt;/math&gt;) or, each time it enters &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; it must pass through twice, because S is bounded, so any ray entering it must exit. So if &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is outside, &lt;math&gt;count_r&lt;/math&gt; is even. Likewise if &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is inside, the same logic applies to the previous case, but the ray must intersect &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; one extra time for the first time it leaves &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. So:

&lt;math&gt;
isInside_r(q) = \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
            1 &amp; count_r \ is \ odd \\
            0 &amp; count_r \ is \ even\\
        \end{array}
    \right.
&lt;/math&gt;

Now, oftentimes we cannot guarantee that the &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is closed. Take the pair of pants example from the top of this article. This mesh clearly has a semantic inside-and-outside, despite there being holes at the waist and the legs.

[[File:Point shooting.gif|thumb|Approximating inside-outside segmentation by shooting rays from a query point for varying number of rays.]]

The naive attempt to solve this problem is to shoot many rays in random directions, and classify &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; as being inside if and only if most of the rays intersected &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; an odd number of times. To quantify this, let us say we cast &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; rays, &lt;math&gt;r_1,r_2,\dots,r_k&lt;/math&gt;. We associate a number &lt;math&gt;rayTest(q) = \frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^{k} isInside_{r_i}(q)&lt;/math&gt; which is the average value of &lt;math&gt;isInside_r&lt;/math&gt; from each ray. Therefore:

&lt;math&gt;
isInside(q) = \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
            1 &amp; rayTest(q) \geq 0.5 \\
            0 &amp; rayTest(q) &lt; 0.5\\
        \end{array}
    \right.
&lt;/math&gt;

In the limit of shooting many, many rays, this method handles open meshes, however it in order to become accurate, far too many rays are required for this method to be computationally ideal. Instead, a more robust approach is the Generalized Winding Number.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Jacobson|first1=Alec|last2=Ladislav|first2=Kavan|last3=[[Olga Sorkine-Hornung|Sorkine-Hornung]]|first3=Olga|year=2013|title=Robust Inside-Outside Segmentation using Generalized Winding Numbers|url=http://igl.ethz.ch/projects/winding-number/robust-inside-outside-segmentation-using-generalized-winding-numbers-siggraph-2013-jacobson-et-al.pdf|journal=ACM Transactions on Graphics |volume=32|issue=4|pages=1|via=|doi=10.1145/2461912.2461916}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the 2D [[winding number]], this approach uses the [[solid angle]] at &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; of each triangle in the mesh to determine if &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is inside or outside. The value of the Generalized Winding Number at &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;wn(q)&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to the sum of the solid angle contribution from each triangle in the mesh:

&lt;math&gt;wn(q) = \frac{1}{4\pi}\sum_{t \in F} solidAngle(t)&lt;/math&gt;

For a closed mesh, &lt;math&gt;wn(q)&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to the characteristic function for the volume represented by &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, we say:

&lt;math&gt;
isInside(q) = \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
            1 &amp; wn(q) \geq 0.5 \\
            0 &amp; wn(q) &lt; 0.5 \\
        \end{array}
    \right.
&lt;/math&gt;

Because &lt;math&gt;wn(q)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[harmonic function]], it degrades gracefully, meaning the inside-outside segmentation would not change much if we poked holes in a closed mesh. For this reason, the Generalized Winding Number handles open meshes robustly. The boundary between inside and outside smoothly passes over holes in the mesh. In fact, in the limit, the Generalized Winding Number is equivalent to the ray-casting method as the number of rays goes to infinity.

      <text bytes="6062" xml:space="preserve">'''Ordered geometry''' is a form of [[geometry]] featuring the concept of intermediacy (or "betweenness") but, like [[projective geometry]], omitting the basic notion of measurement.  Ordered geometry is a fundamental geometry forming a common framework for [[affine geometry|affine]], [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]], [[absolute geometry|absolute]], and [[hyperbolic geometry]] (but not for projective geometry).

==History==
[[Moritz Pasch]] first defined a geometry without reference to measurement in 1882.  His axioms were improved upon by [[Giuseppe Peano|Peano]] (1889), [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] (1899), and [[Oswald Veblen|Veblen]] (1904).&lt;ref name=Coxeter69&gt;{{cite book | last=Coxeter | first=H.S.M. | authorlink=Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter | title=Introduction to Geometry | url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoge0002coxe | url-access=registration | edition=2nd | publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]] | year=1969 | isbn=0-471-18283-4 | zbl=0181.48101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|176}}  Euclid anticipated Pasch's approach in definition 4 of ''The Elements'':  "a straight line is a line which lies evenly with the points on itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Heath | first=Thomas | author-link=Thomas Little Heath | pages=[https://archive.org/details/thirteenbooksofe00eucl/page/165 165] | title=The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements (Vol 1) | location=New York | publisher=[[Dover Publications]] | year=1956 | origyear=1925 | isbn=0-486-60088-2 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/thirteenbooksofe00eucl/page/165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primitive concepts==
The only [[primitive notion]]s in ordered geometry are [[Point (geometry)|points]] A, B, C, ... and the [[ternary relation]] of intermediacy [ABC] which can be read as "B is between A and C".

==Definitions==

The ''segment'' AB is the set of points P such that [APB].

The ''interval'' AB is the segment AB and its end points A and B.

The ''ray'' A/B (read as "the ray from A away from B") is the set of points P such that [PAB].

The ''line'' AB is the interval AB and the two rays A/B and B/A.  Points on the line AB are said to be ''collinear''.

An ''angle'' consists of a point O (the ''vertex'') and two non-collinear rays out from O (the ''sides'').

A ''triangle'' is given by three non-collinear points (called ''vertices'') and their three ''segments'' AB, BC, and CA.

If three points A, B, and C are non-collinear, then a ''plane'' ABC is the set of all points collinear with pairs of points on one or two of the sides of triangle ABC.

If four points A, B, C, and D are non-coplanar, then a ''space'' ([[3-space]]) ABCD is the set of all points collinear with pairs of points selected from any of the four ''faces'' (planar regions) of the [[tetrahedron]] ABCD.

==Axioms of ordered geometry==
# There exist at least two points.
# If A and B are distinct points, there exists a C such that [ABC].
# If [ABC], then A and C are distinct (A≠C).
# If [ABC], then [CBA] but not [CAB].
# If C and D are distinct points on the line AB, then A is on the line CD.
# If AB is a line, there is a point C not on the line AB.
# ([[Axiom of Pasch]]) If ABC is a triangle and [BCD] and [CEA], then there exists a point F on the line DE for which [AFB].
# Axiom of [[dimensionality]]:
## For planar ordered geometry, all points are in one plane.  Or
## If ABC is a plane, then there exists a point D not in the plane ABC.
# All points are in the same plane, space, etc. (depending on the dimension one chooses to work within).
# (Dedekind's Axiom) For every partition of all the points on a line into two nonempty sets such that no point of either lies between two points of the other, there is a point of one set  which lies between every other point of that set  and every point of the other set.

These axioms are closely related to [[Hilbert's axioms#II. Order|Hilbert's axioms of order]]. For a comprehensive survey of axiomatizations of ordered geometry see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pambuccian | first = Victor | doi = 10.1016/j.exmath.2010.09.004 | journal = Expositiones Mathematicae | pages = 24–66 | title = The axiomatics of ordered geometry: I. Ordered incidence spaces | volume = 29 | year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
===Sylvester's problem of collinear points===
The [[Sylvester–Gallai theorem]] can be proven within ordered geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pambuccian | first = Victor | journal = Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic | pages = 245–260 | title = A Reverse Analysis of the Sylvester–Gallai Theorem | volume = 50 | year = 2009 | zbl=1202.03023 | doi=10.1215/00294527-2009-010| doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Coxeter69/&gt;{{rp|181,2}}

===Parallelism===
[[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], [[János Bolyai|Bolyai]], and [[Nikolai Lobachevsky|Lobachevsky]] developed a notion of [[parallel postulate|parallelism]] which can be expressed in ordered geometry.&lt;ref name=Coxeter69/&gt;{{rp|189,90}}

'''Theorem (existence of parallelism):''' Given a point A and a line r, not through A, there exist exactly two limiting rays from A in the plane Ar which do not meet r.  So there is a ''parallel'' line through A which does not meet r.

'''Theorem (transmissibility of parallelism):''' The parallelism of a ray and a line is preserved by adding or subtracting a segment from the beginning of a ray.

The transitivity of parallelism cannot be proven in ordered geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Busemann | first=Herbert | pages=139 | title=Geometry of Geodesics | location=New York | publisher=[[Academic Press]] | year=1955 | zbl=0112.37002 | series=Pure and Applied Mathematics | volume=6 | isbn=0-12-148350-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the "ordered" concept of parallelism does not form an [[equivalence relation]] on lines.

'''Hatch marks''' (also called '''hash marks''' or '''tick marks''') are a form of [[mathematical notation]]. They are used in three ways as: 
* Unit and value marks — as on a ruler or number line
* [[Congruence (geometry)|Congruence]] notation in [[geometry]] — as on a [[geometric figure]]
* Graphed points — as on a [[Chart|graph]]

Hatch marks are frequently used as an abbreviation of some common units of measurement. In regard to distance, a single hatch mark indicates feet, and two hatch marks indicate inches. In regard to time, a single hatch mark indicates minutes, and two hatch marks indicate seconds.

In [[geometry]] and [[trigonometry]], such marks are used following an [[Degree symbol|elevated circle]] to indicate degrees, minutes, and seconds — '''(&amp;nbsp;°&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;′&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;&amp;Prime;&amp;nbsp;).'''

Hatch marks can probably be traced to [[hatching]] in art works, where the pattern of the hatch marks represents a unique tone or hue. Different patterns indicate different tones.

==Unit and value marks==
Unit-and-value hatch marks are short vertical line segments which mark distances. They are seen on [[ruler]]s and [[number line]]s. The marks are parallel to each other in a evenly-spaced manner.

The distance between adjacent marks is one unit. Longer line segments are used for [[integer]]s and [[natural number]]s. Shorter line segments are used for [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]s.

Hatch marks provide a visual clue as to the value of specific points on the number line, even if some hatch marks are not labeled with a number.

Hatch marks are typically seen in [[number theory]] and [[geometry]].

==Congruency notation==
[[Image:Hatch marks.svg|thumb|300px|Matching hatch marks are used here to indicate equal lengths. The two triangles are [[congruence relation|congruent]] and are [[ mirror image]]s of each other.]]
In [[geometry]], hatch marks are used to denote equal measures of angles, arcs, line segments, or other elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2020-04-17|title=List of Geometry and Trigonometry Symbols|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/geometry-trigonometry-symbols/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-09-01|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Basic Geometric Symbols and Labeling - MathBitsNotebook (Geo - CCSS Math)|url=https://mathbitsnotebook.com/Geometry/BasicTerms/BTnotation2.html|access-date=2020-09-01|website=mathbitsnotebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Introduction to Geometry {{!}} SkillsYouNeed|url=https://www.skillsyouneed.com/num/geometry.html|access-date=2020-09-01|website=www.skillsyouneed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hatch marks for congruence notation are in the style of [[tally mark]]s or of [[Roman numerals]] – with some qualifications. These marks are without [[serif]]s, and some patterns are not used. For example, the numbers I, II, III, V, and X are used, but IV and VI are not used, since a rotation of 180 degrees can make a 4 easily confused with a 6.

For example, if two triangles are drawn, the first pair of [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] sides can be marked with a single hatch mark on each. The second pair of congruent sides can be marked with two hatch marks each. The patterns are not alike: one pair uses one mark while the other pair uses two marks (Figure 1). This use of pattern makes it clear which sides are the same length, even if the sides cannot be measured. If the sides do not appear to be congruent, as long as hatch marks are present and are the same number of hatch marks, then the sides are congruent.

Note that the inverse situation should not be assumed. That is, while sides that are hatch marked identically must be assumed to be congruent, it does not follow that sides hatch marked ''differently'' must be ''incongruent''.  The different hatch marks simply signal that the length measurements may be considered to be independent of each other.  So, for example, while the triangles in the accompanying figure cannot be shown to be [[Isosceles_triangle|isosceles triangles]] or [[Equilateral_triangle|equilateral triangles]], it is nevertheless possible that they ''could'' be either of those.

==Graphed points==
[[Line chart]]s may sometimes use hatch marks as graphed points. In the early days of computers, monitors and printers could only make charts using the characters available on a common typewriter. To graph a line chart of sales over time, symbols such as *, x, or | were used to mark points, and various characters were used to mark the lines connecting them. While computers have advanced considerably, it is still not unusual to see x or | used as the points of interest (or points of change) on a graph.

      <text bytes="2942" xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], '''Tarski's plank problem''' is a question about coverings of convex regions in ''n''-dimensional Euclidean space by "planks": regions between two hyperplanes. [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]] asked if the sum of the widths of the planks must be at least the minimum width of the convex region. The question was answered affirmatively by 
{{harvs|txt=yes|first=Thøger|last=Bang|year=1950|year2=1951}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=King, Jonathan L.|title=Three problems in search of a measure|journal=Amer. Math. Monthly|volume=101|year=1994|pages=609–628|url=http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/three-problems-in-search-of-a-measure-0|doi=10.2307/2974690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement==
[[File:Tarski plank problem.svg|right|320px]]
Given a [[convex body]] ''C'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and a hyperplane ''H'', the width of ''C'' parallel to ''H'', ''w''(''C'',''H''), is the distance between the two [[supporting hyperplane]]s of ''C'' that are parallel to ''H''.  The smallest such distance (i.e. the [[infimum]] over all possible hyperplanes) is called the minimal width of ''C'', ''w''(''C'').

The (closed) set of points ''P'' between two distinct, parallel hyperplanes in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is called a plank, and the distance between the two hyperplanes is called the width of the plank, ''w''(''P'').  Tarski conjectured that if a convex body ''C'' of minimal width ''w''(''C'') was covered by a collection of planks, then the sum of the widths of those planks must be at least ''w''(''C'').  That is, if ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''P''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; are planks such that
:&lt;math&gt;C\subseteq P_1\cup\ldots\cup P_m\subset \R^n,&lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^m w(P_i)\geq w(C).&lt;/math&gt;
Bang proved this is indeed the case.

==Nomenclature==
The name of the problem, specifically for the sets of points between parallel hyperplanes, comes from the visualisation of the problem in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  Here, hyperplanes are just straight lines and so planks become the space between two parallel lines.  Thus the planks can be thought of as (infinitely long) [[Plank (wood)|planks of wood]], and the question becomes how many planks does one need to completely cover a [[convex polygon|convex]] tabletop of minimal width ''w''?  Bang's theorem shows that, for example, a circular [[Table (furniture)|table]] of [[diameter]] ''d'' feet can't be covered by fewer than ''d'' planks of wood of width one foot each.

[[File:Mamikons Theorem.svg|thumb|right|300px|Mamikon's theorem - the area of the tangent clusters are equal. Here the original curve with the tangents drawn from it is a semicircle.]]
'''Visual calculus''', invented by [[Mamikon Mnatsakanian]] (known as Mamikon), is an approach to solving a variety of [[Integral|integral calculus]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cco.caltech.edu/~mamikon/calculus.html Visual Calculus] Mamikon Mnatsakanian&lt;/ref&gt; Many problems that would otherwise seem quite difficult yield to the method with hardly a line of calculation, often reminiscent of what [[Martin Gardner]] calls "aha! solutions" or Roger Nelsen a [[proof without words]].&lt;ref&gt;Nelsen, Roger B. (1993). ''Proofs without Words'', Cambridge University Press. {{isbn|978-0-88385-700-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Gardner (1978) ''Aha! Insight'', W.H. Freeman &amp; Company; {{isbn|0-7167-1017-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Mamikon_annulus_area_visualisation.svg|thumb|upright|Illustration of Mamikon's method showing that the areas of two annuli with the same chord length are the same regardless of inner and outer radii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Edge of the Universe: Celebrating Ten Years of Math Horizons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I9oVP8TlyqIC&amp;pg=PA70|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Mamikon devised his method in 1959 while an undergraduate, first applying it to a well-known geometry problem: Find the area of a ring ([[annulus (mathematics)|annulus]]), given the length of a chord tangent to the inner circumference. (Perhaps surprisingly, no additional information is needed; the solution does not depend on the ring's inner and outer dimensions.)

The traditional approach involves algebra and application of the Pythagorean theorem. Mamikon's method, however, envisions an alternate construction of the ring: First the inner circle alone is drawn, then a constant-length tangent is made to travel along its circumference, "sweeping out" the ring as it goes.

Now if all the (constant-length) tangents used in constructing the ring are translated so that their points of tangency coincide, the result is a circular disk of known radius (and easily computed area). Indeed, since the inner circle's radius is irrelevant, one could just as well have started with a circle of radius zero (a point)&amp;mdash;and sweeping out a ring around a circle of zero radius is indistinguishable from simply rotating a line segment about one of its endpoints and sweeping out a disk.

Mamikon's insight was to recognize the equivalence of the two constructions; and because they are equivalent, they yield equal areas. Moreover, so long as it is given that the tangent length is constant, the two starting curves need not be circular&amp;mdash;a finding not easily proven by more traditional geometric methods. This yields '''Mamikon's theorem''':
:''The area of a tangent sweep is equal to the area of its tangent cluster, regardless of the shape of the original curve.''

==Applications==
[[Tom M. Apostol|Tom Apostol]] has produced a very readable introduction to the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its.caltech.edu/~mamikon/VisualCalc.html A VISUAL Approach to CALCULUS problems] An introduction by Tom Apostol&lt;/ref&gt; In it he shows that the problems of finding the area of a [[cycloid]] and [[tractrix]] can be solved by very young students. "Moreover, the new method also solves some problems ''unsolvable by calculus, and allows many incredible generalizations yet unknown in mathematics''." He also mentions that combining Mamikon's method with the geometric solution yields a new proof of the Pythagorean Theorem. Solutions to many other problems appear on Mamikon's Visual Calculus site.

===Area of a cycloid===
[[File:Mamikon Cycloid.svg|thumb|right|300px|Finding the area of a [[cycloid]] using Mamikon's theorem.]]

The area of a [[cycloid]] can be calculated by considering the area between it and an enclosing rectangle. These tangents can all be clustered to form a circle. If the circle generating the cycloid has radius {{math|''r''}} then this circle also has radius {{math|''r''}} and area {{math|π''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The area of the rectangle is {{math|2''r'' × 2π''r'' {{=}} 4π''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Therefore the area of the cycloid is {{math|3π''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}: it is 3 times the area of the generating circle.

The tangent cluster can be seen to be a circle because the cycloid is generated by a circle and the tangent to the cycloid will be at right angle to the line from the generating point to the rolling point. Thus the tangent and the line to the contact point form a right-angled triangle in the generating circle. This means that clustered together the tangents will describe the shape of the generating circle.

      <text bytes="4951" xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], a '''Benz plane''' is a type of 2-[[dimension]]al [[Geometry|geometrical]] structure, named after the [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] [[Walter Benz]]. The term was applied to a group of objects that arise from a common [[axiomatization]] of certain structures and split into three families, which were introduced separately: [[Möbius plane]]s, [[Laguerre plane]]s, and [[Minkowski plane]]s.&lt;ref&gt;W. Benz, ''Vorlesungen über Geomerie der Algebren'', [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;F. Buekenhout (ed.), ''Handbook of [[Incidence (geometry)|Incidence Geometry]]'', [[Elsevier]] (1995) {{ISBN|0-444-88355-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Möbius plane ==
{{main|Möbius plane}}

[[Image:Moebius-2d3d-model.svg|400px|thumb|classical Möbius plane: 2d/3d model]]
Starting from the [[real number|real]] [[Euclidean plane]] and merging the set of lines with the set of circles to form a set of blocks results in an inhomogeneous [[incidence structure]]: three distinct points determine one block, but lines are distinguishable as a set of blocks that pairwise mutually [[intersection|intersect]] at one point without being tangent (or no points when parallel). Adding to the point set the new point &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, defined to lie on every line results in every block being determined by exactly three points, as well as the intersection of any two blocks following a uniform pattern (intersecting at two points, tangent or non-intersecting). This homogeneous geometry is called classical inversive geometry or a Möbius plane.  The inhomogeneity of the description (lines, circles, new point) can be seen to be non-substantive by using a 3-dimensional model. Using a [[stereographic projection]], the classical Möbius plane may be seen to be isomorphic to the geometry of [[plane section]]s (circles) on a sphere in Euclidean 3-space. 

Analogously to the (axiomatic) [[projective plane]], an (axiomatic) Möbius plane defines an incidence structure. 
Möbius planes may similarly be constructed over [[field (mathematics)|field]]s other than the real numbers.

== Laguerre plane==
{{main|Laguerre plane}}

[[Image:Laguerre-2d3d-model.svg|400px|thumb|classical Laguerre plane: 2d/3d-model]]
Starting again from &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \R^2 &lt;/math&gt; and taking the curves with equations &lt;math&gt;y=ax^2+bx+c&lt;/math&gt; (parabolas and lines) as blocks, the following homogenization is effective: Add to the curve &lt;math&gt;y=ax^2+bx+c&lt;/math&gt; the new point &lt;math&gt;(\infty,a)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the set of points is &lt;math&gt;  (\R\cup{\infty})\times\R&lt;/math&gt;. This geometry of parabolas is called the classical Laguerre plane (Originally it was designed as the geometry of the oriented lines and circles. Both geometries are isomorphic.)

As for the Möbius plane, there exists a 3-dimensional model: the geometry of the elliptic plane sections on an orthogonal cylinder (in &lt;math&gt;\R^3&lt;/math&gt;). An abstraction leads (analogously to the Möbius plane) to the axiomatic Laguerre plane.

==Minkowski plane==
{{main|Minkowski plane}}
[[Image:Minkowski-2d3d-model.svg|400px|thumb|classical Minkowski plane: 2d/3d-model]]
Starting from &lt;math&gt;\R^2 &lt;/math&gt; and merging the lines &lt;math&gt;y=mx+d, m\ne0&lt;/math&gt; with the hyperbolas &lt;math&gt;y=\tfrac{a}{x-b}+c, a\ne0&lt;/math&gt; in order to get the set of blocks, the following idea homogenizes the incidence structure: Add to any line the point 
&lt;math&gt;(\infty,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; and to any hyperbola &lt;math&gt;y=\tfrac{a}{x-b}+c, a\ne0&lt;/math&gt; the two points &lt;math&gt;(b,\infty), (\infty,c)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the point set is &lt;math&gt;(\R\cup{\infty})^2&lt;/math&gt;. This geometry of the hyperbolas is called the classical Minkowski plane.

Analogously to the classical Möbius and Laguerre planes, there exists a 3-dimensional model: The classical Minkowski plane is isomorphic to the geometry of plane sections of a hyperboloid of one sheet (non degenerated quadric of index 2) in 3-dimensional projective space.  Similar to the first two cases we get the (axiomatic) Minkowski plane.

==Planar circle geometries or Benz planes==
Because of the essential role of the circle (considered as the non-degenerate [[conic]] in a [[projective plane]]) and the plane description of the original models the three types of geometries are subsumed to planar circle geometries or in honor of Walter Benz, who considered these geometric structures from a common point of view, Benz planes.

      <text bytes="4724" xml:space="preserve">In [[algebraic geometry]], an '''infinitely near point''' of an algebraic surface ''S'' is a point on a surface obtained from ''S'' by repeatedly blowing up points. Infinitely near points of [[algebraic surface]]s were introduced by {{harvs|txt|first=Max|last=Noether|authorlink=Max Noether|year=1876}}.&lt;ref&gt;''Infinitely Near Points on Algebraic Surfaces'', Gino Turrin, ''American Journal of Mathematics'', Vol. 74, No. 1 (Jan., 1952), pp. 100–106&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some other meanings of "infinitely near point". Infinitely near points can also be defined for higher-dimensional varieties: there are several inequivalent ways to do this, depending on what one is allowed to blow up. Weil gave a definition of infinitely near points of smooth varieties,&lt;ref&gt;[4] Weil, A., ''Theorie des points proches sur les variétés differentielles'', Colloque de Topologie et Geometrie Diferentielle, Strasbourg, 1953, 111–117; in his ''Collected Papers'' II. The notes to the paper there indicate this was a rejected project for the [[Bourbaki group]]. Weil references [[Pierre de Fermat]]'s approach to calculus, as well as the jets of [[Charles Ehresmann]]. For an extended treatment, see O. O. Luciano, ''Categories of multiplicative functors and Weil's infinitely near points'',  Nagoya Math. J.  109 (1988), 69–89 (online [https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.nmj/1118780892 here]) for a full discussion.&lt;/ref&gt; though these are not the same as infinitely near points in algebraic geometry.
In the line of [[hyperreal number]]s, an extension of the [[real number]] line, two points are called infinitely near if their difference is [[infinitesimal]].

== Definition==

When [[blowing up]] is applied to a point ''P'' on a surface ''S'', the new surface ''S''* contains a whole curve ''C'' where ''P'' used to be. The points of ''C'' have the geometric interpretation as the tangent directions at ''P'' to ''S''. They can be called infinitely near to ''P'' as way of visualizing them on ''S'', rather than ''S''*. More generally this construction can be iterated by blowing up a point on the new curve ''C'', and so on.

An '''infinitely near point''' (of order ''n'') ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; on a surface ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is given by a sequence of points ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; on surfaces ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; such that  ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is given by blowing up ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''–1&lt;/sub&gt; at the point ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''–1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is a point of the surface ''S''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; with image ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''–1&lt;/sub&gt;.

In particular the points of the surface ''S'' are the infinitely near points on ''S'' of order 0.

Infinitely near points correspond to 1-dimensional valuations of the function field of ''S'' with 0-dimensional center, and in particular correspond to some of the points of the [[Zariski–Riemann surface]]. (The 1-dimensional valuations with 1-dimensional center correspond to irreducible curves of ''S''.) It is also possible to iterate the construction infinitely often, producing an infinite sequence ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,... of infinitely near points. These infinite sequences correspond to the 0-dimensional valuations of the function field of the surface, which correspond to the "0-dimensional" points of the [[Zariski–Riemann surface]].

==Applications==

If ''C'' and ''D'' are distinct irreducible curves on a smooth surface ''S'' intersecting at a point ''p'', then the multiplicity of their intersection at ''p'' is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{x \text{ infinitely near }p} m_x(C)m_x(D)&lt;/math&gt;
where ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'') is the multiplicity of ''C'' at ''x''. In general this is larger than ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'')''m''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''D'') if ''C'' and ''D'' have a common tangent line at ''x'' so that they also intersect at infinitely near points of order greater than&amp;nbsp;0, for example if ''C'' is the line ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and ''D'' is the parabola ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(0,0).

The genus of ''C'' is given by 
:&lt;math&gt; g(C)=g(N)+\sum_{\text{infinitely near points }x}m_x(m_x-1)/2&lt;/math&gt;
where ''N'' is the normalization of ''C'' and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is the multiplicity of the infinitely near point ''x'' on ''C''.

In [[geometry]], an '''axis-aligned object''' ('''axis-parallel''', '''axis-oriented''') is an object in ''n''-dimensional space whose shape is aligned with the [[coordinate axes]] of the space. 

Examples are [[axis-aligned rectangle]]s (or [[hyperrectangle]]s), the ones with edges parallel to the coordinate axes. [[Minimum bounding box]]es are often implicitly assumed to be axis-aligned. A more general case is [[rectilinear polygon]]s, the ones with all sides parallel to coordinate axes or rectilinear polyhedra. 

Many problems in [[computational geometry]] allow for faster algorithms when restricted to (collections of) axis-oriented objects, such as axis-aligned rectangles or axis-aligned line segments.

A different kind of example are axis-aligned ellipsoids, i.e., the [[ellipsoid]]s with principal axes parallel to the coordinate axes.

      <text bytes="6461" xml:space="preserve">In [[geometry]], a set of points in space are '''coplanar''' if there exists a geometric [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] that contains them all. For example, three points are always coplanar, and if the points are distinct and [[non-collinear points|non-collinear]], the plane they determine is unique. However, a set of four or more distinct points will, in general, not lie in a single plane.

Two [[Line (geometry)|lines]] in three-dimensional space are coplanar if there is a plane that includes them both. This occurs if the lines are [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]], or if they [[Line-line intersection|intersect]] each other. Two lines that are not coplanar are called [[skew lines]].

[[Distance geometry]] provides a solution technique for the problem of determining whether a set of points is coplanar, knowing only the distances between them.

==Properties in three dimensions==
In three-dimensional space, two [[linearly independent]] vectors with the same initial point determine a plane through that point. Their [[cross product]] is a [[normal (geometry)|normal]] vector to that plane, and any vector [[orthogonal]] to this cross product through the initial point will lie in the plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Earl W.|last=Swokowski|title=Calculus with Analytic Geometry|edition=Alternate|year=1983|publisher=Prindle, Weber &amp; Schmidt|isbn=0-87150-341-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/calculuswithanal00swok/page/647 647]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/calculuswithanal00swok/page/647}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to the following coplanarity test using a [[scalar triple product]]:

Four distinct points, {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} are coplanar if and only if,
:&lt;math&gt;[(x_2 - x_1) \times (x_4 - x_1)] \cdot (x_3 - x_1) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
which is also equivalent to
:&lt;math&gt;(x_2 - x_1) \cdot [(x_4 - x_1) \times (x_3 - x_1)] = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
 
If three vectors {{math|'''a''', '''b'''}} and {{math|'''c'''}} are coplanar, then if {{math|1='''a'''⋅'''b''' = 0}} (i.e., {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} are orthogonal) then
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{c}\cdot\mathbf{\hat a})\mathbf{\hat a} + (\mathbf{c}\cdot\mathbf{\hat b})\mathbf{\hat b}  = \mathbf{c}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat a}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[unit vector]] in the direction of {{math|'''a'''}}. That is, the [[vector projection]]s of {{math|'''c'''}} on {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''c'''}} on {{math|'''b'''}} add to give the original {{math|'''c'''}}.

Another technique involves computing the formula for the planes defined by each subset of three non-[[collinear]] points. First, the [[normal vector]] for each plane is computed using some [[orthogonalization]] technique. If the planes are parallel, then the dot-product of their unit normal vectors will be 1 or −1. More specifically, the angle between the normal vectors can be computed. This is called the dihedral angle, and represents the smallest possible angle between the two planes. The formula for a plane in 3-dimensional space is:

:&lt;math&gt;ax+by+cz+d=0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;(a,b,c)&lt;/math&gt; is the normal vector of the plane.

The value &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; can be computed by substituting one of the points and then solving. If &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the same for all subsets of three points, then the planes are the same.

One advantage of this technique is that it can work in higher dimensional spaces. For example, suppose one wants to compute the dihedral angle between two ''m''-dimensional hyperplanes defined by ''m'' points in (''m'' + 1)-dimensional space. If &lt;math&gt;n-m&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, then there are an infinite number of normal vectors for each hyperplane, so the angle between two of them is not necessarily the dihedral angle. However, if the [[Gram–Schmidt process]] is used, using the same initial vector in both cases, then the angle between the two normal vectors will be minimal, and therefore will be the dihedral angle between the hyperplanes.

==Coplanarity of points in ''n'' dimensions whose coordinates are given==

Since three or fewer points are always coplanar, the problem of determining when a set of points are coplanar is generally of interest only when there are at least four points involved. In the case that there are exactly four points, several ad hoc methods can be employed, but a general method that works for any number of points uses vector methods and the property that a plane is determined by two [[linearly independent vectors]].

In an {{math|''n''}}-dimensional space ({{math|''n'' ≥ 3}}), a set of {{math|''k''}} points, {{math|{''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;} }} are coplanar if and only if the matrix of their relative differences, that is, the matrix whose columns (or rows) are the vectors &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{p_0 p_1}, \overrightarrow{p_0 p_2}, \ldots, \overrightarrow{p_0 p_{k-1}} &lt;/math&gt; is of [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] 2 or less. 

For example, given four points, {{math|1=''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;#8239;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;#8239;...&amp;#8239;,&amp;#8239;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), ''Y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;#8239;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;#8239;...&amp;#8239;,&amp;#8239;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), ''Z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;#8239;''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;#8239;...&amp;#8239;,&amp;#8239;''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, and {{math|1=''W''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;#8239;''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;#8239;...&amp;#8239;,&amp;#8239;''w''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, if the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 - w_1 &amp; x_2 - w_2 &amp; \dots &amp; x_n - w_n \\
y_1 - w_1 &amp; y_2 - w_2 &amp; \dots &amp; y_n - w_n \\
z_1 - w_1 &amp; z_2 - w_2 &amp; \dots &amp; z_n - w_n \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
is of rank 2 or less, the four points are coplanar.

In the special case of a plane that contains the origin, the property can be simplified in the following way:
A set of {{math|''k''}} points and the origin are coplanar if and only if the matrix of the coordinates of the {{mvar|k}} points is of rank 2 or less.

==Geometric shapes==

A [[skew polygon]] is a [[polygon]] whose [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] are not coplanar. Such a polygon must have at least four vertices; there are no skew triangles.

A [[polyhedron]] that has positive [[volume]] has vertices that are not all coplanar.

      <text bytes="7375" xml:space="preserve">In mathematics, '''real trees''' (also called '''&lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;-trees''') are a class of [[metric space]]s generalising [[Tree (graph theory)|simplicial trees]]. They arise naturally in many mathematical contexts, in particular [[geometric group theory]] and probability theory. They are also the simplest examples of [[Gromov hyperbolic space]]s.

== Definition and examples ==

=== Formal definition ===

[[File:Y property.png|130px|thumb|A triangle in a real tree]]

A metric space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a real tree if it is a [[Geodesic metric space|geodesic space]] where every triangle is a tripod. That is, for every three points &lt;math&gt;x, y, \rho \in X&lt;/math&gt; there exists a point &lt;math&gt;c = x \wedge y&lt;/math&gt; such that the geodesic segments &lt;math&gt;[\rho,x], [\rho,y]&lt;/math&gt; intersect in the segment &lt;math&gt;[\rho,c]&lt;/math&gt; and also &lt;math&gt;c \in [x,y]&lt;/math&gt;. This definition is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; being a "zero-hyperbolic space" in the sense of Gromov (all triangles are "zero-thin"). 
Real trees can also be characterised by a topological property. A metric space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a real tree if for any pair of points &lt;math&gt;x, y \in X&lt;/math&gt; all (topological) embeddings &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; of the segment &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\sigma(0) = x, \, \sigma(1) = y&lt;/math&gt; have the same image (which is then a geodesic segment from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;).

=== Simple examples ===

*If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a graph with the combinatorial metric then it is a real tree if and only if it is a tree (i.e. it has no cycles). Such a tree is often called a simplicial tree. They are characterised by the following topological property: a real tree &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is simplicial if and only if the set of singular points of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; (points whose complement in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has three or more connected components) is discrete in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.
* The R-tree obtained in the following way is nonsimplicial. Start with the interval [0,2] and glue, for each positive integer n, an interval of length 1/n to the point 1−1/n in the original interval. The set of singular points is discrete, but fails to be closed since 1 is an ordinary point in this R-tree. Gluing an interval to 1 would result in a closed set of singular points at the expense of discreteness.
* The Paris metric makes the plane into a real tree. It is defined as follows: one fixes an origin &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, and if two points are on the same ray from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, their distance is defined as the Euclidean distance. Otherwise, their distance is defined to be the sum of the Euclidean distances of these two points to the origin &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.
* More generally any [[hedgehog space]] is an example of a real tree.

== In mathematical context ==

Real trees often appear, in various situations, as limits of more classical metric spaces.

=== Brownian trees ===

A [[brownian tree]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Aldous | first = D. | authorlink = David Aldous | date = 1991 | title = The continuum random tree I | journal = [[Annals of Probability]] | volume = 19 | pages = 1–28.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a (non-simplicial) real tree almost surely. Brownian trees arise as limits of various random processes on finite trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Aldous | first = D. | authorlink = David Aldous | date = 1991 | title = The continuum random tree III | journal = [[Annals of Probability]] | volume = 21 | pages = 248–289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ultralimits of metric spaces ===

Any [[ultralimit]] of a sequence &lt;math&gt;(X_i)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\delta_i&lt;/math&gt;-[[Hyperbolic metric space|hyperbolic]] spaces with &lt;math&gt;\delta_i \to 0&lt;/math&gt; is a real tree. In particular, the [[Ultralimit#Asymptotic cones|asymptotic cone]] of any hyperbolic space is a real tree.

=== Limit of group actions ===

Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group. For a sequence of based &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-spaces &lt;math&gt;(X_i, *_i, \rho_i)&lt;/math&gt; there is a notion of convergence to a based &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-space &lt;math&gt;(X_\infty, x_\infty, \rho_\infty)&lt;/math&gt; due to M. Bestvina and F. Paulin. When the spaces are hyperbolic and the actions are unbounded the limit (if it exists) is a real tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Bestvina | first = Mladen | authorlink = Mladen Bestvina | editor-last1 = | editor-first1 = | title = Handbook of Geometric Topology | contribution = &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;-trees in topology, geometry and group theory | pages = 55–91 | year = 2002 | publisher = Elsevier | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8OYxdADnhZoC&amp;pg=PA55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple example is obtained by taking &lt;math&gt;G = \pi_1(S)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a compact surface, and &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; the universal cover of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; with the metric &lt;math&gt;i\rho&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is a fixed hyperbolic metric on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;).

This is useful to produce actions of hyperbolic groups on real trees. Such actions are analyzed using the so-called [[Rips machine]]. A case of particular interest is the study of degeneration of groups acting properly discontinuously on a [[Hyperbolic space|real hyperbolic space]] (this predates Rips', Bestvina's and Paulin's work and is due to J. Morgan and [[Peter Shalen|P. Shalen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

=== Algebraic groups ===

If &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a field with an [[ultrametric space|ultrametric]] [[Valuation (algebra)|valuation]] then the [[Building (mathematics)|Bruhat–Tits building]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(F)&lt;/math&gt; is a real tree. It is simplicial if and only if the valuations is discrete.

== Generalisations ==

=== &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;-trees ===

If &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a totally ordered abelian group there is a natural notion of a distance with values in &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; (classical metric spaces correspond to &lt;math&gt;\Lambda = \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;). There is a notion of &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;-tree&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Chiswell | first = Ian

The structure of finitely presented groups acting freely on &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; -trees was described.  &lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = O. Kharlampovich,  A. Myasnikov, D.  Serbin | title = Actions, length functions and non-archimedean words IJAC 23, No. 2, 2013.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, such a group acts freely on some  &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; -tree.

=== Real buildings ===

The axioms for a [[Building (mathematics)|building]] can be generalized to give a definition of a real building. These arise for example as asymptotic cones of higher-rank [[symmetric spaces]] or as Bruhat—Tits buildings of higher-rank groups over valued fields.

[[File:Cavalieri's Principle in Coins.JPG|thumb|250px|Two stacks of British coins with the same volume, illustrating Cavalieri's principle in three dimensions]]

In [[geometry]], '''Cavalieri's principle''', a modern implementation of the '''method of indivisibles''', named after [[Bonaventura Cavalieri]], is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Howard Eves, "Two Surprising Theorems on Cavalieri Congruence", ''The College Mathematics Journal'', volume 22, number 2, March, 1991), pages 118&amp;ndash;124&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''2-dimensional case''': Suppose two regions in a plane are included between two parallel lines in that plane. If every line parallel to these two lines intersects both regions in line segments of equal length, then the two regions have equal areas.
* '''3-dimensional case''': Suppose two regions in three-space (solids) are included between two parallel planes. If every plane parallel to these two planes intersects both regions in [[cross section (geometry)|cross-sections]] of equal area, then the two regions have equal volumes.

Today Cavalieri's principle is seen as an early step towards [[integral calculus]], and while it is used in some forms, such as its generalization in [[Fubini's theorem]], results using Cavalieri's principle can often be shown more directly via integration. In the other direction, Cavalieri's principle grew out of the ancient Greek [[method of exhaustion]], which used limits but did not use [[infinitesimal]]s.

== History ==
[[File:Bonaventura Cavalieri.jpeg|thumb|right|140px|[[Bonaventura Cavalieri]], the mathematician the principle is named after.]]
Cavalieri's principle was originally called the method of indivisibles, the name it was known by in [[Renaissance Europe]]. Cavalieri developed a complete theory of indivisibles, elaborated in his ''Geometria indivisibilibus continuorum nova quadam ratione promota'' (''Geometry, advanced in a new way by the indivisibles of the continua'', 1635) and his ''Exercitationes geometricae sex'' (''Six geometrical exercises'', 1647).&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor J. Katz|Katz, Victor J.]] (1998), ''A History of Mathematics: An Introduction'' (2nd ed.), Addison-Wesley, p. 477.&lt;/ref&gt; While Cavalieri's work established the principle, in his publications he denied that the continuum was composed of indivisibles in an effort to avoid the associated paradoxes and religious controversies, and he did not use it to find previously unknown results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Alexander|first=Amir|title=Infinitesimal: How a Dangerous Mathematical Theory Shaped the Modern World|publisher=Oneworld|year=2015|isbn=978-1-78074-642-5|location=Great Britain|pages=101-103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 3rd century BC, [[Archimedes]], using a method resembling Cavalieri's principle,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Archimedes-Lost-Method-1084593|title=Archimedes' Lost Method|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; was able to find the volume of a sphere given the volumes of a cone and cylinder in his work ''[[The Method of Mechanical Theorems]]''. In the 5th century AD, [[Zu Chongzhi]] and his son [[Zu Gengzhi]] established a similar method to find a sphere's volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Calculus: Early Transcendentals |edition=3 |first1=Dennis G. |last1=Zill |first2=Scott |last2=Wright |first3=Warren S. |last3=Wright |publisher=[[Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning]] |year=2009 |isbn=0-7637-5995-3 |page=xxvii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R3Hk4Uhb1Z0C}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=R3Hk4Uhb1Z0C&amp;pg=PR27 Extract of page 27]&lt;/ref&gt; The transition from Cavalieri's indivisibles to [[Evangelista Torricelli]]'s and [[John Wallis]]'s [[infinitesimal]]s was a major advance in the history of the [[integral calculus|calculus]]. The indivisibles were entities of [[codimension]] 1, so that a plane figure was thought as made out of an infinity of 1-dimensional lines. Meanwhile, infinitesimals were entities of the same dimension as the figure they make up; thus, a plane figure would be made out of "parallelograms" of infinitesimal width. Applying the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression, Wallis computed the area of a triangle by partitioning it into infinitesimal parallelograms of width&amp;nbsp;1/∞.

== Examples ==

=== Spheres ===
[[Image:sphere cavalieri.svg|500px|thumb|The disk-shaped cross-section of the sphere has the same area as the ring-shaped cross-section of that part of the cylinder that lies ''outside'' the cone.]]

If one knows that the volume of a [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}\left(\text{base} \times \text{height}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, then one can use Cavalieri's principle to derive the fact that the volume of a [[sphere]] is &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the radius.

That is done as follows: Consider a sphere of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and a cylinder of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and height &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. Within the cylinder is the cone whose apex is at the center of one base of the cylinder and whose base is the other base of the cylinder. By the [[Pythagorean theorem]], the plane located &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; units above the "equator" intersects the sphere in a circle of radius &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{r^2-y^2}&lt;/math&gt; and area &lt;math&gt;\pi\left(r^2 - y^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;. The area of the plane's intersection with the part of the cylinder that is ''outside'' of the cone is also &lt;math&gt;\pi\left(r^2 - y^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;. As we can see, the area of every intersection of the circle with the horizontal plane located at any height &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; equals the area of the intersection of the plane with the part of the cylinder that is "outside" of the cone; thus, applying Cavalieri's principle, we could say that the volume of the half sphere equals the volume of the part of the cylinder that is "outside" the cone. The aforementioned volume of the cone is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt; of the volume of the cylinder, thus the volume ''outside'' of the cone is &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt; the volume of the cylinder. Therefore the volume of the upper half of the sphere is &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt; of the volume of the cylinder. The volume of the cylinder is

:&lt;math&gt;\text{base} \times \text{height} = \pi r^2 \cdot r = \pi r^3&lt;/math&gt;

("Base" is in units of ''area''; "height" is in units of ''distance''. Area&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;distance&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;volume.)

Therefore the volume of the upper half-sphere is &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3} \pi r^3&lt;/math&gt; and that of the whole sphere is &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Cones and pyramids ===

The fact that the volume of any [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]], regardless of the shape of the base, whether circular as in the case of a cone, or square as in the case of the Egyptian pyramids, or any other shape, is (1/3)&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;base&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;height, can be established by Cavalieri's principle if one knows only that it is true in one case. One may initially establish it in a single case by partitioning the interior of a triangular prism into three pyramidal components of equal volumes. One may show the equality of those three volumes by means of Cavalieri's principle.

In fact, Cavalieri's principle or similar infinitesimal argument is ''necessary'' to compute the volume of cones and even pyramids, which is essentially the content of [[Hilbert's third problem]] – polyhedral pyramids and cones cannot be cut and rearranged into a standard shape, and instead must be compared by infinite (infinitesimal) means. The ancient Greeks used various precursor techniques such as Archimedes's mechanical arguments or [[method of exhaustion]] to compute these volumes.

===The napkin ring problem===

{{main|Napkin ring problem}}

[[Image:sphere bands.svg|thumb|400px|If a hole of height ''h'' is drilled straight through the center of a sphere, the volume of the remaining band does not depend on the size of the sphere. For a larger sphere, the band will be thinner but longer.]]

In what is called the [[napkin ring problem]], one shows by Cavalieri's principle that when a hole is drilled straight through the centre of a sphere where the remaining band has height ''h'', the volume of the remaining material surprisingly does not depend on the size of the sphere.  The cross-section of the remaining ring is a plane annulus, whose area is the difference between the areas of two circles.  By the Pythagorean theorem, the area of one of the two circles is ''π'' times ''r''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''r'' is the sphere's radius and ''y'' is the distance from the plane of the equator to the cutting plane, and that of the other is ''π'' times ''r''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;(''h''/2)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  When these are subtracted, the ''r''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt; cancels; hence the lack of dependence of the bottom-line answer upon&amp;nbsp;''r''.

=== Cycloids ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[visual calculus]]. --&gt;

[[Image:Folded cycloid.svg|thumb|400px|The horizontal cross-section of the region bounded by two cycloidal arcs traced by a point on the same circle rolling in one case clockwise on the line below it, and in the other counterclockwise on the line above it, has the same length as the corresponding horizontal cross-section of the circle.]]

N. Reed has shown&lt;ref&gt;N. Reed, "[[Elementary proof]] of the area under a cycloid", ''[[Mathematical Gazette]]'', volume 70, number 454, December, 1986, pages 290&amp;ndash;291&lt;/ref&gt; how to find the area bounded by a [[cycloid]] by using Cavalieri's principle. A circle of radius ''r'' can roll in a clockwise direction upon a line below it, or in a counterclockwise direction upon a line above it. A point on the circle thereby traces out two cycloids. When the circle has rolled any particular distance, the angle through which it would have turned clockwise and that through which it would have turned counterclockwise are the same. The two points tracing the cycloids are therefore at equal heights. The line through them is therefore horizontal (i.e. parallel to the two lines on which the circle rolls). Consequently each horizontal cross-section of the circle has the same length as the corresponding horizontal cross-section of the region bounded by the two arcs of cyloids.  By Cavalieri's principle, the circle therefore has the same area as that region.

Consider the rectangle bounding a single cycloid arch. From the definition of a cycloid, it has width {{math|2π''r''}} and height {{math|2''r''}}, so its area is four times the area of the circle. Calculate the area within this rectangle that lies above the cycloid arch by bisecting the rectangle at the midpoint where the arch meets the rectangle, rotate one piece by 180° and overlay the other half of the rectangle with it. The new rectangle, of area twice that of the circle, consists of the "lens" region between two cycloids, whose area was calculated above to be the same as that of the circle, and the two regions that formed the region above the cycloid arch in the original rectangle. Thus, the area bounded by a rectangle above a single complete arch of the cycloid has area equal to the area of the circle, and so, the area bounded by the arch is three times the area of the circle.

In [[mathematics]], the '''flatness''' (symbol: '''⏥''') of a [[surface (mathematics)|surface]] is the degree to which it approximates a [[Plane (mathematics)|mathematical plane]]. The term is often generalized for higher-dimensional [[manifold]]s to describe the degree to which they approximate the [[Euclidean space]] of the same dimensionality. (See ''[[curvature]]''.)

'''Flatness''' in [[homological algebra]] and [[algebraic geometry]] means, of an object &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in an [[abelian category]], that &lt;math&gt;- \otimes A&lt;/math&gt; is an [[exact functor]].  See [[flat module]] or, for more generality, [[flat morphism]].

      <text bytes="2515" xml:space="preserve">[[Image:TwoCells.png|thumb|A trivial example of a Corner-point grid with only two cells.]]
In [[geometry]], a '''corner-point grid''' is a [[tessellation]] of a [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] 3D volume where the base cell has 6 [[Face (geometry)|faces]] ([[hexahedron]]).

A set of straight lines defined by their end points define the ''pillars'' of the corner-point grid. The pillars have a lexicographical ordering that determines neighbouring pillars. On each pillar, a constant number of nodes (corner-points) is defined. A corner-point cell is now the volume between 4 neighbouring pillars and two neighbouring points on each pillar. 

Each cell can be identified by integer coordinates &lt;math&gt;(i,j,k)&lt;/math&gt;, where the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; coordinate runs along the pillars, and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; span each layer. The cells are ordered naturally, where the index &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; runs the fastest and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; the slowest.

Data within the interior of such cells can be computed by [[trilinear interpolation]] from the boundary values at the 8 corners, 12 edges, and 6 faces.

In the special case of all pillars being vertical, the top and bottom face of each corner-point cell are described by [[Bilinear interpolation|bilinear surfaces]] and the side faces are [[plane (geometry)|plane]]s.

Corner-point grids are supported by most [[reservoir simulation]] software, and has become an industry standard.

==Degeneracy==

A main feature of the format is the ability to define [[erosion surface]]s in [[geological modelling]], effectively done by collapsing nodes along each pillar. This means that the corner-point cells degenerate and may have less than 6 faces.

For the corner-point grids non-neighboring connections are supported, meaning that grid cells that are not neighboring in ijk-space can be defined as neighboring. This feature allows for representation of faults with significant throw/displacement. Moreover, the neighboring grid cells do not need to have matching cell faces (just overlap).

[[File:Tetrahedral group 2.svg|thumb|right|300px|A [[tetrahedron]] is invariant under 12 distinct [[rotation]]s, reflections excluded. These are illustrated here in the [[Cycle graph (algebra)|cycle graph]] format, along with the 180° edge (blue arrows) and 120° vertex (reddish arrows) [[rotation]]s that [[permutation|permute]] the tetrahedron through the positions. The 12 rotations form the '''rotation (symmetry) group''' of the figure.]]

In [[group theory]], the '''symmetry group''' of a geometric object is the [[group (mathematics)|group]] of all [[Transformation (geometry)|transformation]]s under which the object is [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]], endowed with the group operation of [[Function composition|composition]]. Such a transformation is an invertible mapping of the [[ambient space]] which takes the object to itself, and which preserves all the relevant structure of the object. A frequent notation for the symmetry group of an object ''X'' is ''G'' = Sym(''X'').

For an object in a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] space, its symmetries form a [[subgroup]] of the [[isometry group]] of the ambient space. This article mainly considers [[symmetry]] groups in [[Euclidean geometry]], but the concept may also be studied for more general types of geometric structure.

==Introduction==
We consider the "objects" possessing symmetry to be geometric figures, images, and patterns, such as a [[wallpaper group|wallpaper pattern]]. For symmetry of physical objects, one may also take their physical composition as part of the pattern. (A pattern may be specified formally as a [[scalar field]], a function of position with values in a set of colors or substances; as a [[vector field]]; or as a more general function on the object.) The group of isometries of space induces a [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]] on objects in it, and the symmetry group Sym(''X'') consists of those isometries which map ''X'' to itself (as well as mapping any further pattern to itself). We say ''X'' is ''invariant'' under such a mapping, and the mapping is a ''symmetry'' of ''X''.

The above is sometimes called the '''full symmetry group''' of ''X'' to emphasize that it includes orientation-reversing isometries (reflections, [[glide reflection]]s and [[improper rotation]]s), as long as those isometries map this particular ''X'' to itself. The [[subgroup]] of orientation-preserving symmetries (translations, rotations, and compositions of these) is called its '''proper symmetry group'''.  An object is [[chirality (mathematics)|chiral]] when it has no [[Orientation (vector space)|orientation]]-reversing symmetries, so that its proper symmetry group is equal to its full symmetry group.

Any symmetry group whose elements have a common [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]], which is true if the group is finite or the figure is bounded, can be represented as a [[subgroup]] of the [[orthogonal group]] O(''n'') by choosing the origin to be a fixed point. The proper symmetry group is then a subgroup of the special orthogonal group SO(''n''), and is called the '''rotation group''' of the figure.

In a '''[[Discrete group|discrete symmetry group]]''', the points symmetric to a given point do not [[Limit point|accumulate]] toward a limit point. That is, every [[Orbit (group theory)|orbit]] of the group (the images of a given point under all group elements) forms a [[discrete set]]. All finite symmetry groups are discrete.

Discrete symmetry groups come in three types: (1) finite '''[[point groups]]''', which include only rotations, reflections, inversions and rotoinversions – i.e., the finite subgroups of O(''n''); (2) infinite '''[[Lattice (group)|lattice]] groups''', which include only translations; and (3) infinite '''[[space groups]]''' containing elements of both previous types, and perhaps also extra transformations like [[screw displacement]]s and [[glide reflection]]s. There are also [[continuous symmetry]] groups ([[Lie group]]s), which contain rotations of arbitrarily small angles or translations of arbitrarily small distances. An example is [[orthogonal group|O(3)]], the symmetry group of a sphere. Symmetry groups of Euclidean objects may be completely classified as the [[Euclidean group#Subgroups|subgroups of the Euclidean group]] E(''n'') (the isometry group of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;).

Two geometric figures have the same ''symmetry type'' when their symmetry groups are ''[[Conjugacy class#Conjugacy of subgroups and general subsets|conjugate]]'' subgroups of the Euclidean group: that is, when the subgroups ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are related by {{nowrap|1=''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''g''}} for some ''g'' in E(''n''). For example:

*two 3D figures have mirror symmetry, but with respect to different mirror planes.
*two 3D figures have 3-fold [[rotational symmetry]], but with respect to different axes.
*two 2D patterns have translational symmetry, each in one direction; the two translation vectors have the same length but a different direction.

In the following sections, we only consider isometry groups whose [[Orbit (group theory)|orbits]] are [[Closed (topology)|topologically closed]], including all discrete and continuous isometry groups. However, this excludes for example the 1D group of translations by a [[rational number]]; such a non-closed figure cannot be drawn with reasonable accuracy due to its arbitrarily fine detail.

==One dimension==
The isometry groups in one dimension are:

*the trivial group C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
*the groups of two elements generated by a reflection; they are isomorphic with C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
*the infinite discrete groups generated by a translation; they are isomorphic with '''Z''', the additive group of the integers
*the infinite discrete groups generated by a translation and a reflection; they are isomorphic with the [[Dihedral group#Generalizations|generalized dihedral group]] of '''Z''',  Dih('''Z'''), also denoted by D&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; (which is a [[semidirect product]] of '''Z''' and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).
*the group generated by all translations (isomorphic with the additive group of the real numbers '''R'''); this group cannot be the symmetry group of a Euclidean figure, even endowed with a pattern: such a pattern would be homogeneous, hence could also be reflected. However, a constant one-dimensional vector field has this symmetry group.
*the group generated by all translations and reflections in points; they are isomorphic with the [[Dihedral group#Generalizations|generalized dihedral group]] Dih('''R''').

See also [[symmetry groups in one dimension]].

==Two dimensions==
[[Up to]] conjugacy the discrete point groups in two-dimensional space are the following classes:

*[[cyclic group]]s C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ... where C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; consists of all rotations about a fixed point by multiples of the angle 360°/''n''
*[[dihedral group]]s D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [[Dihedral group of order 6|D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Examples of groups#The symmetry group of a square: dihedral group of order 8|D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], ..., where D&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; (of order 2''n'') consists of the rotations in C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; together with reflections in ''n'' axes that pass through the fixed point.

C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[trivial group]] containing only the identity operation, which occurs when the figure is asymmetric, for example the letter "F". C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the symmetry group of the letter "Z", C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; that of a [[triskelion]], C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; of a [[swastika]], and C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, etc. are the symmetry groups of similar swastika-like figures with five, six, etc. arms instead of four.

D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the 2-element group containing the identity operation and a single reflection, which occurs when the figure has only a single axis of [[reflection symmetry|bilateral symmetry]], for example the letter "A".

D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is isomorphic to the [[Klein four-group]], is the symmetry group of a non-equilateral rectangle. This figure has four symmetry operations: the identity operation, one twofold axis of rotation, and two nonequivalent mirror planes.

D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; etc. are the symmetry groups of the [[regular polygon]]s.

Within each of these symmetry types, there are two [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] for the center of rotation, and in the case of the dihedral groups, one more for the positions of the mirrors.

The remaining isometry groups in two dimensions with a fixed point are:
*the special [[orthogonal group]] SO(2) consisting of all rotations about a fixed point; it is also called  the [[circle group]] S&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the multiplicative group of [[complex number]]s of [[absolute value]] 1. It is the ''proper'' symmetry group of a circle and the continuous equivalent of C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. There is no geometric figure that has as ''full'' symmetry group the circle group, but for a vector field it may apply (see the three-dimensional case below). 
*the orthogonal group O(2) consisting of all rotations about a fixed point and reflections in any axis through that fixed point. This is the symmetry group of a circle. It is also called Dih(S&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) as it is the [[dihedral group|generalized dihedral group]] of S&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Non-bounded figures may have isometry groups including translations; these are:
*the 7 [[frieze group]]s 
*the 17 [[wallpaper group]]s
*for each of the symmetry groups in one dimension, the combination of all symmetries in that group in one direction, and the group of all translations in the perpendicular direction
*ditto with also reflections in a line in the first direction.

==Three dimensions==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Bipyramid]] --&gt;
{{see also|Point groups in three dimensions}}

[[Up to]] conjugacy the set of three-dimensional point groups consists of 7 infinite series, and 7 other individual groups. In crystallography, only those point groups are considered which preserve some crystal lattice (so their rotations may only have order 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6). This [[crystallographic restriction theorem|crystallographic restriction]] of the infinite families of general point groups results in 32 crystallographic point groups (27 individual groups from the 7 series, and 5 of the 7 other individuals).

The continuous symmetry groups with a fixed point include those of:
*cylindrical symmetry without a symmetry plane perpendicular to the axis, this applies for example for a beer [[bottle]]
*cylindrical symmetry with a symmetry plane perpendicular to the axis
*spherical symmetry

For objects with [[scalar field]] patterns, the cylindrical symmetry implies vertical reflection symmetry as well. However, this is not true for [[vector field]] patterns: for example, in [[cylindrical coordinates]] with respect to some axis, the vector field 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = A_\rho\boldsymbol{\hat \rho} + A_\phi\boldsymbol{\hat \phi} + A_z\boldsymbol{\hat z}&lt;/math&gt; has cylindrical symmetry with respect to the axis whenever &lt;math&gt;A_\rho, A_\phi,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; A_z&lt;/math&gt; have this symmetry (no dependence on &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;); and it has reflectional symmetry only when &lt;math&gt;A_\phi = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

For spherical symmetry, there is no such distinction: any patterned object has planes of reflection symmetry.

The continuous symmetry groups without a fixed point include those with a [[screw axis]], such as an infinite [[helix]]. See also [[Euclidean group#Subgroups|subgroups of the Euclidean group]].

==Symmetry groups in general==
{{see also|Automorphism|Automorphism group}}
In wider contexts, a '''symmetry group''' may be any kind of '''transformation group''', or [[automorphism]] group. Each type of [[mathematical structure]] has [[Bijection|invertible mappings]] which preserve the structure. Conversely, specifying the symmetry group can define the structure, or at least clarify the meaning of geometric congruence or invariance; this is one way of looking at the [[Erlangen programme]].

For example, objects in a hyperbolic [[non-Euclidean geometry]] have [[Fuchsian group|Fuchsian symmetry groups]], which are the discrete subgroups of the isometry group of the hyperbolic plane, preserving hyperbolic rather than Euclidean distance. (Some are depicted in drawings of [[M. C. Escher|Escher]].) Similarly, automorphism groups of [[finite geometry|finite geometries]] preserve families of point-sets (discrete subspaces) rather than Euclidean subspaces, distances, or inner products. Just as for Euclidean figures, objects in any geometric space have symmetry groups which are subgroups of the symmetries of the ambient space.

Another example of a symmetry group is that of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|combinatorial graph]]: a graph symmetry is a permutation of the vertices which takes edges to edges. Any [[Presentation of a group|finitely presented group]] is the symmetry group of its [[Cayley graph]]; the [[free group]] is the symmetry group of an infinite [[Tree (graph theory)|tree graph]].

==Group structure in terms of symmetries==
[[Cayley's theorem]] states that any abstract group is a subgroup of the permutations of some set ''X'', and so can be considered as the symmetry group of ''X'' with some extra structure. In addition, many abstract features of the group (defined purely in terms of the group operation) can be interpreted in terms of symmetries.

For example, let ''G'' = Sym(''X'') be the finite symmetry group of a figure ''X'' in a Euclidean space, and let ''H'' &amp;sub; ''G'' be a subgroup. Then ''H'' can be interpreted as the symmetry group of ''X''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, a "decorated" version of ''X''. Such a decoration may be constructed as follows. Add some patterns such as arrows or colors to ''X'' so as to break all symmetry, obtaining a figure ''X''&lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt; with Sym(''X''&lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt;) = {1}, the trivial subgroup; that is, ''gX''&lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;ne; ''X''&lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt; for all non-trivial ''g'' &amp;isin; ''G''. Now we get:
:&lt;math&gt;
X^+ \ = \ \bigcup_{h\in H} hX^{\#} \quad\text{satisfies}\quad 
H = \mathrm{Sym}(X^+).
&lt;/math&gt;

[[Normal subgroup]]s may also be characterized in this framework. 
The symmetry group of the translation ''gX'' &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is the conjugate subgroup ''gHg''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus ''H'' is normal whenver:
:&lt;math&gt; 
\mathrm{Sym}(gX^+) = \mathrm{Sym}(X^+) \ \ \text{for all} \ g\in G;
&lt;/math&gt;
that is, whenever the decoration of ''X''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; may be drawn in any orientation, with respect to any side or feature of ''X'', and still yield the same symmetry group ''gHg''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''H''.

As an example, consider the dihedral group ''G'' = ''D''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = Sym(''X''), where ''X'' is an equilateral triangle. We may decorate this with an arrow on one edge, obtaining an asymmetric figure ''X''&lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt;. Letting &amp;tau; &amp;isin; ''G'' be the reflection of the arrowed edge, the composite figure ''X''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; = ''X''&lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;cup; &amp;tau;''X''&lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt; has a bidirectional arrow on that edge, and its symmetry group is ''H'' = {1, &amp;tau;}. This subgroup is not normal, since ''gX''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; may have the bi-arrow on a different edge, giving a different reflection symmetry group.

However, letting H = {1, &amp;rho;, &amp;rho;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;} &amp;sub; ''D''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; be the cyclic subgroup generated by a rotation, the decorated figure ''X''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; consists of a 3-cycle of arrows with consistent orientation. Then ''H'' is normal, since drawing such a cycle with either orientation yields the same symmetry group ''H''.

[[File:Mandel zoom 00 mandelbrot set.jpg|thumb|The [[Mandelbrot set]], one of the most famous examples of mathematical visualization.]]
[[Mathematics|Mathematical]] phenomena can be understood and explored via [[Visualization (graphic)|visualization]]. Classically this consisted of two-dimensional drawings or building three-dimensional models (particularly plaster models in the 19th and early 20th century), while today it most frequently consists of [[Scientific computing|using computers]] to make static two or three dimensional drawings, animations, or interactive programs. Writing programs to visualize mathematics is an aspect of [[computational geometry]].

==Applications==
Mathematical visualization is used throughout mathematics, particularly in the fields of [[geometry]] and [[analysis]]. Notable examples include [[plane curve]]s, [[space curve]]s, [[polyhedra]], [[ordinary differential equation]]s, [[partial differential equation]]s (particularly numerical solutions, as in [[fluid dynamics]] or [[minimal surface]]s such as [[soap film]]s), [[conformal map]]s, [[fractal]]s, and [[Chaos theory|chaos]].

      <text bytes="5904" xml:space="preserve">The '''analyst's traveling salesman problem''' is an analog of the [[traveling salesman problem]] in [[combinatorial optimization]]. In its simplest and original form, it asks under what conditions may a set ''E'' in two-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; be contained inside a [[curve|rectifiable curve]] of finite length. So while in the original traveling salesman problem, one asks for the shortest way to visit every vertex in a graph with a discrete path, this analytical version requires the curve to visit perhaps infinitely many points.

==β-numbers==

A posteriori, for ''E'' to be contained in a rectifiable curve Γ, since Γ has [[tangent]]s at ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-almost every point in Γ (where ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; denotes one-dimensional [[Hausdorff measure]]), ''E'' must look ''flat'' when you zoom in on points in ''E''. This suggests that a condition that would tell us whether a set could be contained in a curve must somehow incorporate information about how flat ''E'' is when we zoom in on points of ''E'' at different scales.

This discussion motivates the definition of the following quantity: 
:&lt;math&gt;\beta_{E}(Q)=\frac{1}{\ell(Q)}\inf\{\delta:\text{ there is a line }L\text{ so that for every }x\in E\cap Q, \; \text{dist}(x,L)&lt;\delta\},&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''Q'' is any square, &lt;math&gt;\ell(Q)&lt;/math&gt; is the sidelength of ''Q'', and dist(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''L'') measures the distance from ''x'' to the line ''L''. Intuitively, &lt;math&gt;2\beta_E(Q)\ell(Q)&lt;/math&gt; is the width of the smallest rectangle containing the portion of ''E'' inside ''Q'', and hence &lt;math&gt;\beta_E(Q)&lt;/math&gt; gives us a scale invariant notion of ''flatness''.

==Jones' traveling salesman theorem in R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;==

Let Δ denote the collection of dyadic squares, that is,

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta=\{[i2^{k},(i+1)2^{k}]\times[j2^{k},(j+1)2^{k}]: i,j,k\in\mathbb{Z}\},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of integers. For a set &lt;math&gt;E\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;, define

:&lt;math&gt;\beta(E)=\text{diam} E+ \sum_{Q\in\Delta}\beta_{E}(3Q)^2 \ell(Q)&lt;/math&gt;

where diam ''E'' is the [[diameter]] of ''E''. Then Peter Jones'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| bibcode = 1990InMat.102....1J}}&lt;/ref&gt; analyst's traveling salesman theorem may be stated as follows:

* There is a number ''C''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that whenever ''E'' is a set with such that ''β''(''E'')&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;∞, ''E'' can be contained in a curve with length no more than ''Cβ''(''E'').
* Conversely (and substantially more difficult to prove), if Γ is a rectifiable curve, then ''β''(Γ)&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;CH&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Γ).

==Generalizations and Menger curvature==

===Euclidean space and Hilbert space===
The Traveling Salesman Theorem was shown to hold in general Euclidean spaces by Kate Okikiolu,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Okikiolu | first = Kate | authorlink = Kate Okikiolu
  | title =  Characterization of subsets of rectifiable curves in Rn
  | journal =[[Journal of the London Mathematical Society]]| volume = 46 | issue = 2 | pages = 336–348 | year = 1992 | doi=10.1112/jlms/s2-46.2.336
}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, the same theorem above holds for sets &lt;math&gt;E\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt;, ''d''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, where Δ is now the collection of dyadic cubes in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; defined in a similar way as dyadic squares. In her proof, the constant ''C'' grows exponentially with the dimension&amp;nbsp;''d''.

With some slight modifications to the definition of ''β''(''E''), Raanan Schul&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Schul | first = Raanan | authorlink = Raanan Schul
  | title =  Subsets of Rectifiable curves in Hilbert Space—The Analyst's TSP
  | journal =Journal d'Analyse Mathématique| volume = 103 | pages = 331–375 | year = 2007 | doi=10.1007/s11854-008-0011-y
| arxiv =math/0602675}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed Traveling Salesman Theorem also holds for sets ''E'' that lie in any [[Hilbert Space]], and in particular, implies the theorems of Jones and Okikiolu, where now the constant ''C'' is independent of dimension. (In particular, this involves using ''β''-numbers of balls instead of cubes).

===Menger curvature and metric spaces===
Hahlomaa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Hahlomaa | first = Immo | authorlink = Immo Hahlomaa
  | title =  Menger curvature and Lipschitz parametrizations in metric spaces
  | journal =Fund. Math.| volume = 185 | issue = 2 | pages = 143–169 | year = 2005 | doi=10.4064/fm185-2-3
| doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; further adjusted the definition of ''β''(''E'') to get a condition for when a set ''E'' of an arbitrary [[metric space]] may be contained in the [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz]]-image of a subset &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; of positive measure. For this, he had to redefine the definition of the ''β''-numbers using [[menger curvature]] (since in a metric space there isn't necessarily a notion of a cube or a straight line).

[[Menger curvature]], as in the previous example, can be used to give numerical estimates that determine whether a set contains a rectifiable subset, and the proofs of these results frequently depend on ''β''-numbers.

=== Denjoy–Riesz theorem ===
The [[Denjoy–Riesz theorem]] gives general conditions under which a point set can be covered by the homeomorphic image of a curve. This is true, in particular, for every compact [[totally disconnected]] subset of the Euclidean plane. However, it may be necessary for such an arc to have infinite length, failing to meet the conditions of the analyst's traveling salesman theorem.

      <text bytes="2373" xml:space="preserve">In [[geometry]], a '''supporting line''' ''L'' of a [[curve]] ''C'' in the plane is a line that contains a point of ''C'', but does not separate any two points of ''C''.&lt;ref name=Busemann&gt;"The geometry of geodesics", Herbert Busemann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=t22O0XBtyJsC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=%22supporting+line%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Ld2HTKz-Ion2tgPxo7jSCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22supporting%20line%22&amp;f=false p. 158]&lt;/ref&gt; In other words,  ''C'' lies completely in one of the two [[closed set|closed]] [[half-plane]]s defined by ''L'' and has at least one point on ''L''.

==Properties==
There can be many supporting lines for a curve at a given point. When a [[tangent]] exists at a given point, then it is the unique supporting line at this point, if it does not separate the curve.

==Generalizations==
The notion of supporting line is also discussed for planar shapes. In this case a supporting line may be defined as a line which has common points with the boundary of the shape, but not with its interior.&lt;ref name=deza&gt;"Encyclopedia of Distances", by [[Michel M. Deza]], Elena Deza, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LXEezzccwcoC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;lpg=PA178&amp;dq=%22Grenander+distance%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M5OO7_lKSS&amp;sig=yYmvRO5vMw4Xk4HH69_NIao3YNA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=U9eHTJS1JoG4sAOR1P3dCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Grenander%20distance%22&amp;f=false p. 179]&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of a supporting line to a planar curve or convex shape can be generalized to n dimension as a [[supporting hyperplane]].

==Critical support lines==
If two bounded connected planar shapes have disjoint [[convex hull]]s that are separated by a positive distance, then they necessarily have exactly four common lines of support, the [[bitangent]]s of the two convex hulls. Two of these lines of support separate the two shapes, and are called '''critical support lines'''.&lt;ref name=deza/&gt; Otherwise there may be more or fewer than four lines of support, even if the shapes themselves are disjoint. For instance, if one shape is an [[Annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] that contains the other, then there are no common lines of support, while if each of two shapes consists of a pair of small disks at opposite corners of a square then there may be as many as 16 common lines of support.

[[File:De Raum zeit Minkowski Bild.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Hermann Minkowski]] (1864–1909)  found that the theory of special relativity, introduced by his former student [[Albert Einstein]], could be best understood as a four-dimensional space, since known as the Minkowski spacetime.]]
In [[mathematical physics]], '''Minkowski space''' (or '''Minkowski spacetime''') ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ŋ|ˈ|k|ɔː|f|s|k|i|,_|-|ˈ|k|ɒ|f|-}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/minkowski"Minkowski"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a combination of [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Euclidean space]] and [[time]] into a four-dimensional [[manifold]] where the [[spacetime interval]] between any two [[Event (relativity)|events]] is independent of the [[inertial frame of reference]] in which they are recorded. Although initially developed by mathematician [[Hermann Minkowski]] for [[Maxwell's equations]] of electromagnetism, the mathematical structure of Minkowski spacetime was shown to be implied by the [[postulates of special relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|2002|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minkowski space is closely associated with [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] theory of [[special relativity]] and is the most common mathematical structure on which special relativity is formulated. While the individual components in Euclidean space and time may differ due to [[length contraction]] and [[time dilation]], in Minkowski spacetime, all frames of reference will agree on the total distance in spacetime between events.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This makes spacetime distance an [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]].&lt;/ref&gt; Because it treats time differently than it treats the 3 spatial dimensions, Minkowski space differs from [[Four-dimensional space|four-dimensional Euclidean space]].

In 3-dimensional Euclidean space (e.g., simply ''space'' in [[Galilean relativity]]), the [[isometry group]] (the maps preserving the regular [[Euclidean distance]]) is the [[Euclidean group]]. It is generated by [[Rotation matrix|rotations]], [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflections]] and [[Translation (geometry)|translations]]. When time is amended as a fourth dimension, the further transformations of translations in time and [[Galilean boost]]s are added, and the group of all these transformations is called the [[Galilean group]]. All Galilean transformations preserve the ''3-dimensional'' Euclidean distance. This distance is purely spatial. Time differences are ''separately'' preserved as well. This changes in the spacetime of special relativity, where space and time are interwoven.

Spacetime is equipped with an indefinite [[Degenerate bilinear form|non-degenerate]] [[bilinear form]], variously called the ''Minkowski metric'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|1997|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Minkowski norm squared'' or ''Minkowski inner product'' depending on the context.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Consistent use of the terms "Minkowski inner product", "Minkowski norm" or "Minkowski metric" is intended for the bilinear form here, since it is in widespread use. It is by no means "standard" in the literature, but no standard terminology seems to exist.&lt;/ref&gt; The Minkowski inner product is defined so as to yield the [[spacetime interval]] between two events when given their coordinate difference vector as argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Independent Axioms for Minkowski Space–Time |edition=illustrated |first1=John W. |last1=Schutz |publisher=CRC Press |year=1977 |isbn=978-0-582-31760-4 |pages=184–185 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eOO1SWD17GIC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=eOO1SWD17GIC&amp;pg=PA184 Extract of page 184]&lt;/ref&gt; Equipped with this inner product, the mathematical model of spacetime is called Minkowski space. The analogue of the Galilean group for Minkowski space, preserving the spacetime interval (as opposed to the spatial Euclidean distance) is the [[Poincaré group]].

As manifolds, Galilean spacetime and Minkowski spacetime are ''the same''. They differ in what further structures are defined ''on'' them.  The former has the Euclidean distance function and time interval (separately) together with inertial frames whose coordinates are related by Galilean transformations, while the latter has the Minkowski metric together with inertial frames whose coordinates are related by Poincaré transformations.

==History==
{{Spacetime|cTopic=Types}}

===Complex Minkowski spacetime===
{{See also|Four-dimensional space}}
In his second relativity paper in 1905&amp;ndash;06 [[Henri Poincaré]] showed&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Poincaré|1905–1906|pp=129&amp;ndash;176}} Wikisource translation: [[s:Translation:On the Dynamics of the Electron (July)|On the Dynamics of the Electron]]&lt;/ref&gt; how, by taking time to be an imaginary fourth [[spacetime]] coordinate {{math|''ict''}}, where {{mvar|c}} is the [[speed of light]] and {{mvar|i}} is the [[imaginary unit]], Lorentz transformations can be visualized as ordinary rotations of the four dimensional Euclidean sphere

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + (ict)^2 = \text{const}. &lt;/math&gt;

Poincaré set {{math|1=''c'' = 1}} for convenience. Rotations in planes spanned by two space unit vectors appear in coordinate space as well as in physical space time as Euclidean rotations and are interpreted in the ordinary sense. The "rotation" in a plane spanned by a space unit vector and a time unit vector, while formally still a rotation in coordinate space, is a [[Lorentz boost]] in physical spacetime with ''real'' inertial coordinates. The analogy with Euclidean rotations is only partial since the radius of the sphere is actually imaginary which turns rotations into rotations in hyperbolic space.
(see [[Lorentz transformation#Hyperbolic rotation of coordinates|hyperbolic rotation]])

This idea which was mentioned only very briefly by Poincaré, was elaborated in great detail by  Minkowski in an extensive and influential paper in German in 1908 called  "The Fundamental Equations for Electromagnetic Processes in Moving Bodies".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Minkowski|1907–1908|pp=53&amp;ndash;111}} *Wikisource translation: [[s:Translation:The Fundamental Equations for Electromagnetic Processes in Moving Bodies]].&lt;/ref&gt; Minkowski using this formulation restated the then recent theory of relativity of  Einstein. In particular by restating the [[Maxwell equations]] as a symmetrical set of equations in the four variables {{math|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ''ict'')}} combined with redefined vector variables for electromagnetic quantities, he was able to show directly and very simply their invariance under Lorentz transformation. He also made other important contributions and used matrix notation for the first time in this context.
From his reformulation he concluded that time and space should be treated equally, and so arose his concept of events taking place in a unified four-dimensional [[spacetime continuum]].

=== Real Minkowski spacetime ===
In a further development in his 1908 "Space and Time" lecture,&lt;ref name=raumzeit&gt;{{harvnb|Minkowski|1908–1909|pp=75&amp;ndash;88}} Various English translations on Wikisource: "[[s:Translation:Space and Time|Space and Time]]."&lt;/ref&gt; Minkowski gave an alternative formulation of this idea that used a real time coordinate instead of an imaginary one, representing the four variables {{math|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ''t'')}} of space and time in coordinate form in a four dimensional real [[vector space]]. Points in this space correspond to events in spacetime. In this space, there is a defined [[light-cone]] associated with each point, and events not on the light-cone are classified by their relation to the apex as ''spacelike'' or ''timelike''. It is principally this view of spacetime that is current nowadays, although the older view involving imaginary time has also influenced special relativity.

In the English translation of Minkowski's paper, the Minkowski metric as defined below is referred to as the ''line element''. The Minkowski inner product of below appears unnamed when referring to orthogonality (which he calls ''normality'') of certain vectors, and the Minkowski norm squared is referred to (somewhat cryptically, perhaps this is translation dependent) as "sum".

Minkowski's principal tool is the [[Minkowski diagram]], and he uses it to define concepts and demonstrate properties of Lorentz transformations (e.g. [[proper time]] and [[length contraction]]) and to provide geometrical interpretation to the generalization of Newtonian mechanics to [[relativistic mechanics]]. For these special topics, see the referenced articles, as the presentation below will be principally confined to the mathematical structure (Minkowski metric and from it derived quantities and the Poincaré group as symmetry group of spacetime) ''following'' from the invariance of the spacetime interval on the spacetime manifold as consequences of the postulates of special relativity, not to specific application or ''derivation'' of the invariance of the spacetime interval. This structure provides the background setting of all present relativistic theories, barring general relativity for which flat Minkowski spacetime still provides a springboard as curved spacetime is locally Lorentzian.

Minkowski, aware of the fundamental restatement of the theory which he had made, said
{{quote|The views of space and time which I wish to lay before you have sprung from the soil of experimental physics, and therein lies their strength. They are radical. Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality.| Hermann Minkowski, 1908, 1909&lt;ref name=raumzeit/&gt;}}

Though Minkowski took an important step for physics, [[Albert Einstein]] saw its limitation:
{{quote|At a time when Minkowski was giving the geometrical interpretation of special relativity by extending the Euclidean three-space to a [[pseudo-Euclidean space|quasi-Euclidean]] four-space that included time, Einstein was already aware that this is not valid, because it excludes the phenomenon of [[gravitation]]. He was still far from the study of curvilinear coordinates and [[Riemannian geometry]], and the heavy mathematical apparatus entailed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cornelius Lanczos]] (1972) "Einstein's Path from Special to General Relativity", pages 5–19 of ''General Relativity: Papers in Honour of J. L. Synge'', L. O'Raifeartaigh editor, [[Clarendon Press]], see page 11&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Where {{math|''v''}} is velocity, and {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''y''}}, and {{math|''z''}} are [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] coordinates in 3-dimensional space, and {{math|''c''}} is the constant representing the universal speed limit, and {{math|''t''}} is time, the four-dimensional vector {{math|''v'' {{=}} (''ct'', ''x'', ''y'', ''z'') {{=}} (''ct'', '''r''')}} is classified according to the sign of {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. A vector is '''timelike''' if {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, '''spacelike''' if {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and '''null''' or '''lightlike''' if {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This can be expressed in terms of the sign of {{math|''η''(''v'', ''v'')}} as well, which depends on the signature. The classification of any vector will be the same in all frames of reference that are related by a Lorentz transformation (but not by a general Poincaré transformation because the origin may then be displaced) because of the invariance of the interval.

The set of all null vectors at an event&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Translate the coordinate system so that the event is the new origin.&lt;/ref&gt; of Minkowski space constitutes the [[light cone]] of that event. Given a timelike vector {{math|''v''}}, there is a [[worldline]] of constant velocity associated with it, represented by a straight line in a Minkowski diagram.

Once a direction of time is chosen,&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This corresponds to the time coordinate either increasing or decreasing when proper time for any particle increases. An application of {{mvar|T}} flips this direction.&lt;/ref&gt; timelike and null vectors can be further decomposed into various classes. For timelike vectors one has
# future-directed timelike vectors whose first component is positive, (tip of vector located in absolute future in figure) and
# past-directed timelike vectors whose first component is negative (absolute past).
Null vectors fall into three classes:
# the zero vector, whose components in any basis are {{math|(0, 0, 0, 0)}} (origin),
# future-directed null vectors whose first component is positive (upper light cone), and
# past-directed null vectors whose first component is negative (lower light cone).
Together with spacelike vectors there are 6 classes in all.

An [[orthonormal]] basis for Minkowski space necessarily consists of one timelike and three spacelike unit vectors. If one wishes to work with non-orthonormal bases it is possible to have other combinations of vectors. For example, one can easily construct a (non-orthonormal) basis consisting entirely of null vectors, called a '''null basis'''.

[[Vector field]]s are called timelike, spacelike or null if the associated vectors are timelike, spacelike or null at each point where the field is defined.

== Properties of time-like vectors ==

Time-like vectors have special importance in the theory of relativity as they correspond to events which 
are accessible to the observer at (0, 0, 0, 0) with a speed less than that of light. 
Of most interest are time-like vectors which are ''similarly directed'' i.e.all either in the forward or in the backward cones. Such vectors have several properties not shared by space-like vectors. These arise 
because both forward and backward  cones are convex whereas the space-like region is not convex.

=== Scalar product ===

The scalar product of two time-like vectors {{math|''u''{{sub|1}} {{=}} (''t''{{sub|1}}, ''x''{{sub|1}}, ''y''{{sub|1}}, ''z''{{sub|1}})}} and {{math|''u''{{sub|2}} {{=}} (''t''{{sub|2}}, ''x''{{sub|2}}, ''y''{{sub|2}}, ''z''{{sub|2}})}} is

:&lt;math&gt; \eta (u_1, u_2) = u_1 \cdot u_2 = c^2 t_1 t_2 - x_1 x_2 - y_1 y_2 - z_1 z_2 .&lt;/math&gt;

''Positivity of scalar product'': An important property is that the scalar product of two similarly directed time-like vectors is always positive. This can be seen from the reversed Cauchy inequality below. It follows that if the scalar product of two vectors is zero then one of these at least, must be space-like. The scalar product of two space-like vectors can be positive or negative as can be seen by considering the product of two space-like vectors having orthogonal spatial components and times either of different or the same signs.

Using the positivity property of time-like vectors it is easy to verify that a linear sum with positive coefficients of similarly directed time-like vectors is also similarly directed time-like (the sum remains within the light-cone because of convexity).

=== Norm and reversed Cauchy inequality ===

The norm of a time-like vector {{math|''u'' {{=}} (''ct'', ''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}} is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\left\| u \right\| = \sqrt{ \eta(u, u) }  = \sqrt{c^2 t^2 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2}&lt;/math&gt;

''The reversed Cauchy inequality'' is another consequence of the convexity of either light-cone.&lt;ref&gt;See Schutz's proof  p 148, also Naber p.48&lt;/ref&gt;  For two distinct similarly directed time-like vectors {{math|''u''{{sub|1}}}} and {{math|''u''{{sub|2}}}} this inequality is

:&lt;math&gt;\eta(u_1, u_2) &gt; \left\| u_1 \right\|\left\| u_2 \right\|&lt;/math&gt;

or algebraically,

:&lt;math&gt;c^2 t_1 t_2 - x_1 x_2 - y_1 y_2 - z_1 z_2 &gt; \sqrt{\left(c^2 t_1^2 - x_1^2 - y_1^2 - z_1^2\right)\left(c^2t_2^2 - x_2^2 - y_2^2 - z_2^2\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

From this the positivity property of the scalar product can be seen.

=== The reversed triangle inequality ===

For two similarly directed time-like vectors {{math|''u''}} and {{math|''w''}}, the inequality is&lt;ref&gt;Schutz p.148, Naber p.49&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left\| u + w \right\| \ge \left\| u \right\| +  \left\| w \right\|,&lt;/math&gt;
where the equality holds when the vectors are linearly dependent.

The proof uses the algebraic definition with the reversed Cauchy inequality:&lt;ref&gt;Schutz p.148&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\left\| u + w \right\| ^2 = \left\| u \right\|^2 + 2 \left(u, w \right) + \left\| w \right\|^2
                                  \ge \left\| u \right\| ^2 +2 \left\| u \right\| \left\| w \right\| + \left\| w \right\|^2
                                  = \left( \left\| u \right\| +  \left\| w \right\|  \right)^2 &lt;/math&gt;
The result now follows by taking the square root on both sides.

== Mathematical structure ==
It is assumed below that spacetime is endowed with a coordinate system corresponding to an [[inertial frame]]. This provides an ''origin'', which is necessary in order to be able to refer to spacetime as being modeled as a vector space. This is not really ''physically'' motivated in that a canonical origin ("central" event in spacetime) should exist. One can get away with less structure, that of an [[affine space]], but this would needlessly complicate the discussion and would not reflect how flat spacetime is normally treated mathematically in modern introductory literature.

For an overview, Minkowski space is a {{math|4}}-dimensional [[real number|real]] [[vector space]] equipped with  a nondegenerate, [[symmetric bilinear form]] on the [[tangent space]] at each point in spacetime, here simply called the ''Minkowski inner product'', with [[metric signature]] either {{math|(+ − − −)}} or {{math|(− + + +)}}. The tangent space at each event is a vector space of the same dimension as spacetime, {{math|4}}.

=== Tangent vectors ===
[[Image:Image Tangent-plane.svg|thumb|A pictorial representation of the tangent space at a point, {{mvar|x}}, on a [[sphere]]. This vector space can be thought of as a subspace of {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} itself. Then vectors in it would be called ''geometrical tangent vectors''. By the same principle, the tangent space at a point in flat spacetime can be thought of as a subspace of spacetime which happens to be ''all'' of spacetime.]]
In practice, one need not be concerned with the tangent spaces. The vector space nature of Minkowski space allows for the canonical identification of vectors in tangent spaces at points (events) with vectors (points, events) in Minkowski space itself. See e.g. {{harvtxt|Lee|2003|loc=Proposition 3.8.}} These identifications are routinely done in mathematics. They can be expressed formally in Cartesian coordinates as&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|1997|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \left(x^0,\, x^1,\, x^2,\, x^3\right)
    \ &amp;\leftrightarrow\ \left.x^0\mathbf e_0\right|_p + \left.x^1\mathbf e_1\right|_p + \left.x^2\mathbf e_2\right|_p + \left.x^3\mathbf e_3\right|_p \\
    \ &amp;\leftrightarrow\ \left.x^0\mathbf e_0\right|_q + \left.x^1\mathbf e_1\right|_q + \left.x^2\mathbf e_2\right|_q + \left.x^3\mathbf e_3\right|_q,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

with basis vectors in the tangent spaces defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
  \left.\mathbf e_\mu\right|_p = \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu}\right|_p \text{ or }
  \mathbf e_0|_p = \left(\begin{matrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0  \\ 0\end{matrix}\right) \text{, etc}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Here {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}} are any two events and the last identification is referred to as [[parallel transport]]. The first identification is the canonical identification of vectors in the tangent space at any point with vectors in the space itself. The appearance of basis vectors in tangent spaces as first order differential operators is due to this identification. It is motivated by the observation that a geometrical tangent vector can be associated in a one-to-one manner with a [[directional derivative]] operator on the set of smooth functions. This is promoted to a ''definition'' of tangent vectors in manifolds ''not'' necessarily being embedded in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This definition of tangent vectors is not the only possible one as ordinary ''n''-tuples can be used as well.

{{Hidden begin| titlestyle = color:green; background:lightgrey;| title=Definitions of tangent vectors as ordinary vectors}}
A tangent vector at a point {{mvar|p}} may be defined, here specialized to Cartesian coordinates in Lorentz frames, as {{math|4 × 1}} column vectors {{mvar|v}} associated to ''each'' Lorentz frame related by Lorentz transformation {{math|Λ}} such that the vector {{mvar|v}} in a frame related to some frame by {{math|Λ}} transforms according to {{math|''v'' → Λ''v''}}. This is the ''same'' way in which the coordinates {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;}} transform. Explicitly,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  x'^\mu &amp;= {\Lambda^\mu}_\nu x^\nu, \\
  v'^\mu &amp;= {\Lambda^\mu}_\nu v^\nu.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This definition is equivalent to the definition given above under a canonical isomorphism.
{{Hidden end}}

For some purposes it is desirable to identify tangent vectors at a point {{math|''p''}} with ''displacement vectors'' at {{math|''p''}}, which is, of course, admissible by essentially the same canonical identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2003|loc=See Lee's discussion on geometric tangent vectors early in chapter 3.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The identifications of vectors referred to above in the mathematical setting can correspondingly be found in a more physical and explicitly geometrical setting in {{harvtxt|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973}}. They offer various degree of sophistication (and rigor) depending on which part of the material one chooses to read.

=== Metric signature ===
The metric signature refers to which sign the Minkowski inner product yields when given space (''spacelike'' to be specific, defined further down) and time basis vectors (''timelike'') as arguments. Further discussion about this theoretically inconsequential, but practically necessary choice for purposes of internal consistency and convenience is deferred to the hide box below.

{{Hidden begin| titlestyle = color:green;background:lightgrey;|title=The choice of metric signature}}
In general, but with several exceptions, mathematicians and general relativists prefer spacelike vectors to yield a positive sign, {{math|(− + + +)}}, while particle physicists tend to prefer timelike vectors to yield a positive sign, {{math|(+ − − −)}}. Authors covering several areas of physics, e.g. [[Steven Weinberg]] and [[Course of Theoretical Physics|Landau and Lifshitz]] ({{math|(− + + +)}} and {{math|(+ − − −)}} respectively) stick to one choice regardless of topic. Arguments for the former convention include "continuity" from the Euclidean case corresponding to the non-relativistic limit {{math|''c'' → ∞}}. Arguments for the latter include that minus signs, otherwise ubiquitous in particle physics, go away. Yet other authors, especially of introductory texts, e.g. {{harvtxt|Kleppner|Kolenkow|1978}}, do ''not'' choose a signature at all, but instead opt to coordinatize spacetime such that the time ''coordinate'' (but not time itself!) is imaginary. This removes the need of the ''explicit'' introduction of a [[metric tensor]] (which may seem as an extra burden in an introductory course), and one needs ''not'' be concerned with [[covariant vector]]s and [[contravariant vector]]s (or raising and lowering indices) to be described below. The inner product is instead effected by a straightforward extension of the [[dot product]] in {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} to {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; × ℂ}}. This works in the flat spacetime of special relativity, but not in the curved spacetime of general relativity, see {{harvtxt|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973|loc=Box 2.1, Farewell to ''ict''}} (who, by the way use {{math|(− + + +)}}). MTW also argues that it hides the true ''indefinite'' nature of the metric and the true nature of Lorentz boosts, which aren't rotations. It also needlessly complicates the use of tools of [[differential geometry]] that are otherwise immediately available and useful for geometrical description and calculation &amp;ndash; even in the flat spacetime of special relativity, e.g. of the electromagnetic field.
{{Hidden end}}

=== Terminology ===
Mathematically associated to the bilinear form is a [[tensor]] of type {{math|(0,2)}} at each point in spacetime, called the ''Minkowski metric''.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;For comparison and motivation of terminology, take a [[Riemannian metric]], which provides a positive definite symmetric bilinear form, i. e. an [[inner product]] proper at each point on a manifold.&lt;/ref&gt; The Minkowski metric, the bilinear form, and the Minkowski inner product are all the same object; it is a bilinear function that accepts two (contravariant) vectors and returns a real number. In coordinates, this is the {{math|4×4}} matrix representing the bilinear form.

For comparison, in [[general relativity]], a [[Lorentzian manifold]] {{math|''L''}} is likewise equipped with a [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] {{math|''g''}}, which is a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form on the tangent space {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''L''}} at each point {{mvar|p}} of {{math|''L''}}. In coordinates, it may be represented by a {{math|4×4}} matrix ''depending on spacetime position''. Minkowski space is thus a comparatively simple special case of a Lorentzian manifold. Its metric tensor is in coordinates the same symmetric matrix at every point of {{math|''M''}}, and its arguments can, per above, be taken as vectors in spacetime itself.

Introducing more terminology (but not more structure), Minkowski space is thus a [[pseudo-Euclidean space]] with total dimension {{math|''n'' {{=}} 4}} and signature {{math|(3, 1)}} or {{math|(1, 3)}}. Elements of Minkowski space are called [[Event (relativity)|events]]. Minkowski space is often denoted {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3,1&lt;/sup&gt;}} or {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;1,3&lt;/sup&gt;}} to emphasize the chosen signature, or just {{math|''M''}}. It is perhaps the simplest example of a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]].

An interesting example of non-inertial coordinates for (part of) Minkowski spacetime are the [[Born coordinates]]. Another useful set of coordinates are the [[light-cone coordinates]].

=== Pseudo-Euclidean metrics ===
{{main|Pseudo-Euclidean space|Lorentzian manifolds}}
Except for time-like vectors, the Minkowski inner product is not an [[inner product]], since it is not [[Definite bilinear form|positive-definite]], i.e. the [[quadratic form]] {{math|''η''(''v'', ''v'')}} need not be positive for nonzero {{mvar|v}}. The positive-definite condition has been replaced by the weaker condition of non-degeneracy. The bilinear form is said to be ''indefinite''.
The Minkowski metric {{mvar|η}} is the metric tensor of Minkowski space. It is a pseudo-Euclidean metric, or more generally a ''constant'' pseudo-Riemannian metric in Cartesian coordinates. As such it is a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form, a type {{math|(0, 2)}} tensor. It accepts two arguments {{math|''u''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, vectors in {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'', ''p'' ∈ ''M''}}, the tangent space at {{math|''p''}} in {{math|''M''}}. Due to the above-mentioned canonical identification of {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}} with {{math|''M''}} itself, it accepts arguments {{math|''u'', ''v''}} with both {{math|''u''}} and {{math|''v'' }} in {{math|''M''}}.

As a notational convention, vectors {{mvar|v}} in {{mvar|M}}, called [[4-vector]]s, are denoted in italics, and not, as is common in the Euclidean setting, with boldface {{math|'''v'''}}. The latter is generally reserved for the {{math|3}}-vector part (to be introduced below) of a {{math|4}}-vector.

The definition &lt;ref&gt;Giulini 2008 pp. 5,6&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;u \cdot v = \eta(u,\, v)&lt;/math&gt;

yields an inner product-like structure on {{math|''M''}}, previously and also henceforth, called the ''Minkowski inner product'', similar to the Euclidean [[inner product]], but it describes a different geometry. It is also called the ''relativistic dot product''. If the two arguments are the same,

:&lt;math&gt;u \cdot u = \eta(u, u) \equiv \|u\|^2 \equiv u^2,&lt;/math&gt;

the resulting quantity will be called the ''Minkowski norm squared''. The Minkowski inner product satisfies the following properties.

; Linearity in first argument: &lt;math&gt;\eta(au + v,\, w) = a\eta(u,\, w) + \eta(v,\, w),\quad \forall u,\, v \in M,\; \forall a \in \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;
; Symmetry: &lt;math&gt;\eta(u,\, v) = \eta(v,\, u)&lt;/math&gt;
; Non-degeneracy: &lt;math&gt;\eta(u,\, v) = 0,\; \forall v \in M\  \Rightarrow\  u = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The first two conditions imply bilinearity. The defining ''difference'' between a pseudo-inner product and an [[inner product]] proper is that the former is ''not'' required to be positive definite, that is, {{math|''η''(''u'', ''u'') &lt; 0}} is allowed.

The most important feature of the inner product and norm squared is that ''these are quantities unaffected by Lorentz transformations''. In fact, it can be taken as the defining property of a Lorentz transformation that it preserves the inner product (i.e. the value of the corresponding bilinear form on two vectors). This approach is taken more generally for ''all'' classical groups definable this way in [[classical group]]. There, the matrix {{math|Φ}} is identical in the case {{math|O(3, 1)}} (the Lorentz group) to the matrix {{math|''η''}} to be displayed below.

Two vectors {{math|''v''}} and {{math|''w''}} are said to be [[orthogonal]] if {{math|''η''(''v'', ''w'') {{=}} 0}}. For a geometric interpretation of orthogonality in the special case when {{math|''η''(''v'', ''v'') ≤ 0}} and {{math|''η''(''w'', ''w'') ≥ 0}} (or vice versa), see [[hyperbolic orthogonality]].

A vector {{math|''e''}} is called a [[unit vector]] if {{math|''η''(''e'', ''e'') {{=}} ±1}}. A [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for {{math|''M''}} consisting of mutually orthogonal unit vectors is called an [[orthonormal basis]].{{citation needed|reason=M not inner product space|date=October 2017}}

For a given [[inertial frame]], an orthonormal basis in space, combined with the unit time vector, forms an orthonormal basis in Minkowski space. The number of positive and negative unit vectors in any such basis is a fixed pair of numbers, equal to the signature of the bilinear form associated with the inner product. This is [[Sylvester's law of inertia]].

More terminology (but not more structure): The Minkowski metric is a [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]], more specifically, a [[Lorentzian metric]], even more specifically, ''the'' Lorentz metric, reserved for {{math|4}}-dimensional flat spacetime with the remaining ambiguity only being the signature convention.

=== Minkowski metric ===
{{Distinguish|text=[[Minkowski distance]] which is also called Minkowski metric}}
From the [[Postulates of special relativity|second postulate of special relativity]], together with homogeneity of spacetime and isotropy of space, it follows that the [[spacetime interval]] between two arbitrary events called {{math|1}} and {{Math|2}} is:&lt;ref&gt;Minkowski, {{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|2002|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{c^2\left(t_1 - t_2\right)^2 - \left(x_1 - x_2\right)^2 - \left(y_1 - y_2\right)^2 - \left(z_1 - z_2\right)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This quantity is not consistently named in the literature. The interval is sometimes referred to as the square of the interval as defined here.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sard|1970|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not possible to give an exhaustive list of notational inconsistencies. One has to first check out the definitions when consulting the relativity literature.

The invariance of the interval under coordinate transformations between inertial frames follows from the invariance of

:&lt;math&gt;\pm\left[c^2 t^2 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2\right]&lt;/math&gt;

(with either sign {{math|±}} preserved), provided the transformations are linear. This [[quadratic form]] can be used to define a bilinear form

:&lt;math&gt;u \cdot v = \pm\left[c^2 t_1 t_2 - x_1 x_2 - y_1 y_2 - z_1 z_2\right].&lt;/math&gt;

via the [[polarization identity]]. This bilinear form can in turn be written as

:&lt;math&gt;u \cdot v =  u^\textsf{T}[\eta] v,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|[''η'']}} is a {{math|4×4}} matrix associated with {{mvar|η}}. Possibly confusingly, denote {{math|[''η'']}} with just {{mvar|η}} as is common practice. The matrix is read off from the explicit bilinear form as

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \pm \begin{pmatrix}-1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1\end{pmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;

and the bilinear form

:&lt;math&gt;u \cdot v = \eta(u, v),&lt;/math&gt;

with which this section started by assuming its existence, is now identified.

For definiteness and shorter presentation, the signature {{math|(− + + +)}} is adopted below. This choice (or the other possible choice) has no (known) physical implications. The symmetry group preserving the bilinear form with one choice of signature is isomorphic (under the map given [[Classical group#O(p, q) and O(n) – the orthogonal groups|here]]) with the symmetry group preserving the other choice of signature. This means that both choices are in accord with the two postulates of relativity. Switching between the two conventions is straightforward. If the metric tensor {{math|''η''}} has been used in a derivation, go back to the earliest point where it was used, substitute {{math|''η''}} for {{math|−''η''}}, and retrace forward to the desired formula with the desired metric signature.

=== Standard basis ===
A standard basis for Minkowski space is a set of four mutually orthogonal vectors {{math|{ ''e''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; } }} such that
:&lt;math&gt;-\eta(e_0, e_0) = \eta(e_1, e_1) = \eta(e_2, e_2) = \eta(e_3, e_3) = 1 .&lt;/math&gt;

These conditions can be written compactly in the form
:&lt;math&gt;\eta(e_\mu, e_\nu) = \eta_{\mu \nu}.&lt;/math&gt;

Relative to a standard basis, the components of a vector {{math|''v''}} are written {{math|(''v''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, ''v''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''v''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''v''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)}} where the [[Einstein notation]] is used to write {{math|''v'' {{=}} ''v''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;''e''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The component {{math|''v''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}} is called the '''timelike component''' of {{math|''v''}} while the other three components are called the '''spatial components'''. The spatial components of a {{math|4}}-vector {{math|''v''}} may be identified with a {{math|3}}-vector {{math|'''v''' {{=}} (''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.

In terms of components, the Minkowski inner product between two vectors {{math|''v''}} and {{math|''w''}} is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\eta(v, w) = \eta_{\mu \nu} v^\mu w^\nu = v^0 w_0 + v^1 w_1 + v^2 w_2 + v^3 w_3 = v^\mu w_\mu = v_\mu w^\mu,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\eta(v, v) = \eta_{\mu \nu} v^\mu v^\nu = v^0v_0 + v^1 v_1 + v^2 v_2 + v^3 v_3 = v^\mu v_\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

Here '''lowering of an index''' with the metric was used.

====Raising and lowering of indices====
{{main|Raising and lowering indices|tensor contraction}}

[[File:1-form linear functional.svg|thumb|400px|Linear functionals (1-forms) '''α''', '''β''' and their sum '''σ''' and vectors '''u''', '''v''', '''w''', in [[three-dimensional space|3d]] [[Euclidean space]]. The number of (1-form) [[hyperplane]]s intersected by a vector equals the [[inner product]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Technically, a non-degenerate bilinear form provides a map between a vector space and its dual, in this context, the map is between the tangent spaces of {{math|''M''}} and the [[cotangent space]]s of {{math|''M''}}. At a point in {{math|''M''}}, the tangent and cotangent spaces are [[dual vector space]]s (so the dimension of the cotangent space at an event is also {{math|4}}). Just as an authentic inner product on a vector space with one argument fixed, by [[Riesz representation theorem]], may be expressed as the action of a [[linear functional]] on the vector space, the same holds for the Minkowski inner product of Minkowski space.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2003}}. One point in Lee's proof of existence of this map needs modification (Lee deals with [[Riemannian metric]]s.). Where Lee refers to positive definiteness to show injectivity of the map, one needs instead appeal to non-degeneracy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus if {{math|''v''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are the components of a vector in a tangent space, then {{math|''η''&lt;sub&gt;''μν''&lt;/sub&gt;''v''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''ν''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the components of a vector in the cotangent space (a linear functional). Due to the identification of vectors in tangent spaces with vectors in {{math|''M''}} itself, this is mostly ignored, and vectors with lower indices are referred to as '''covariant vectors'''. In this latter interpretation, the covariant vectors are (almost always implicitly) identified with vectors (linear functionals) in the dual of Minkowski space. The ones with upper indices are '''contravariant vectors'''. In the same fashion, the inverse of the map from tangent to cotangent spaces, explicitly given by the inverse of {{math|''η''}} in matrix representation, can be used to define '''raising of an index'''. The components of this inverse are denoted {{math|''η''&lt;sup&gt;''μν''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. It happens that {{math|''η''&lt;sup&gt;''μν''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''η''&lt;sub&gt;''μν''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. These maps between a vector space and its dual can be denoted {{math|''η''&lt;sup&gt;♭&lt;/sup&gt;}} (eta-flat) and {{math|''η''&lt;sup&gt;♯&lt;/sup&gt;}} (eta-sharp) by the musical analogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2003|loc=The tangent-cotangent isomorphism p. 282.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contravariant and covariant vectors are geometrically very different objects. The first can and should be thought of as arrows. A linear functional can be characterized by two objects: its [[kernel (linear algebra)|kernel]], which is a [[hyperplane]] passing through the origin, and its norm. Geometrically thus, covariant vectors should be viewed as a set of hyperplanes, with spacing depending on the norm (bigger = smaller spacing), with one of them (the kernel) passing through the origin. The mathematical term for a covariant vector is 1-covector or [[1-form]] (though the latter is usually reserved for covector ''fields'').

{{harvtxt|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973}} uses a vivid analogy with wave fronts of a [[de Broglie wave]] (scaled by a factor of Planck's reduced constant) quantum mechanically associated to a [[momentum four-vector]] to illustrate how one could imagine a covariant version of a contravariant vector. The inner product of two contravariant vectors could equally well be thought of as the action of the covariant version of one of them on the contravariant version of the other. The inner product is then how many time the arrow pierces the planes. The mathematical reference, {{harvtxt|Lee|2003}}, offers the same geometrical view of these objects (but mentions no piercing).

The [[electromagnetic field tensor]] is a [[2-form|differential 2-form]], which geometrical description can as well be found in MTW.

One may, of course, ignore geometrical views all together (as is the style in e.g. {{harvtxt|Weinberg|2002}} and {{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|2002}}) and proceed algebraically in a purely formal fashion. The time-proven robustness of the formalism itself, sometimes referred to as [[index gymnastics]], ensures that moving vectors around and changing from contravariant to covariant vectors and vice versa (as well as higher order tensors) is mathematically sound. Incorrect expressions tend to reveal themselves quickly.

====The formalism of the Minkowski metric====
The present purpose is to show semi-rigorously how ''formally'' one may apply the Minkowski metric to two vectors and obtain a real number, i.e. to display the role of the differentials, and how they disappear in a calculation. The setting is that of smooth manifold theory, and concepts such as convector fields and exterior derivatives are introduced.

 |title=A formal approach to the Minkowski metric
}}
A full-blown version of the Minkowski metric in coordinates as a tensor field on spacetime has the appearance

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu \otimes dx^\nu = \eta_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu \odot dx^\nu = \eta_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu  dx^\nu.&lt;/math&gt;

Explanation: The coordinate differentials are 1-form fields. They are defined as the [[exterior derivative]] of the coordinate functions {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. These quantities evaluated at a point {{mvar|p}} provide a basis for the cotangent space at {{mvar|p}}. The [[tensor product]] (denoted by the symbol {{math|⊗}}) yields a tensor field of type {{math|(0, 2)}}, i.e. the type that expects two contravariant vectors as arguments. On the right hand side, the [[Symmetric tensor#Symmetric part of a tensor|symmetric product]] (denoted by the symbol {{math|⊙}} or by juxtaposition) has been taken. The equality holds since, by definition, the Minkowski metric is symmetric.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notation on the far right is also sometimes used for the related, but different, [[line element]]. It is ''not'' a tensor. For elaboration on the differences and similarities, see {{harvtxt|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973|loc=Box 3.2 and section 13.2.}}

''Tangent'' vectors are, in this formalism, given in terms of a basis of differential operators of the first order,

:&lt;math&gt;\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu}\right|_p,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|p}} is an event. This operator applied to a function {{mvar|f}} gives the [[directional derivative]] of {{mvar|f}} at {{mvar|p}} in the direction of increasing {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;}} with {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''ν''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''ν'' ≠ ''μ''}} fixed. They provide a basis for the tangent space at {{mvar|p}}.

The exterior derivative {{math|''df''}} of a function {{mvar|f}} is a '''covector field''', i.e. an assignment of a cotangent vector to each point {{math|p}}, by definition such that

:&lt;math&gt;df(X) = Xf,&lt;/math&gt;

for each [[vector field]] {{mvar|X}}. A vector field is an assignment of a tangent vector to each point {{math|p}}. In coordinates {{mvar|X}} can be expanded at each point {{mvar|p}} in the basis given by the {{math|∂/∂''x''&lt;sup&gt;''ν''&lt;/sup&gt;{{!}}&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Applying this with {{math|''f'' {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the coordinate function itself, and {{math|''X'' {{=}} ∂/∂''x''&lt;sup&gt;''ν''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, called a ''coordinate vector field'', one obtains

:&lt;math&gt;dx^\mu\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\nu}\right) = \frac{\partial x^\mu}{\partial x^\nu} = \delta_\nu^\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

Since this relation holds at each point {{mvar|p}}, the {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;{{!}}&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} provide a basis for the cotangent space at each {{mvar|p}} and the bases {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;{{!}}&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|∂/∂''x''&lt;sup&gt;''ν''&lt;/sup&gt;{{!}}&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are [[dual basis|dual]] to each other,

:&lt;math&gt;\left.dx^\mu\right|_p\left(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\nu}\right|_p\right) = \delta^\mu_\nu.&lt;/math&gt;

at each {{mvar|p}}. Furthermore, one has

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \otimes \beta(a, b) = \alpha(a)\beta(b)&lt;/math&gt;

for general one-forms on a tangent space {{math|''α'', ''β''}} and general tangent vectors {{math|''a'', ''b''}}. (This can be taken as a definition, but may also be proved in a more general setting.)

Thus when the metric tensor is fed two vectors fields {{math|''a'', ''b''}}, both expanded in terms of the basis coordinate vector fields, the result is

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu \otimes dx^\nu(a, b) = \eta_{\mu\nu} a^\mu b^\nu,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|''b''&lt;sup&gt;''ν''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are the ''component functions'' of the vector fields. The above equation holds at each point {{mvar|p}}, and the relation may as well be interpreted as the Minkowski metric at {{mvar|p}} applied to two tangent vectors at {{mvar|p}}.

As mentioned, in a vector space, such as that modelling the spacetime of special relativity, tangent vectors can be canonically identified with vectors in the space itself, and vice versa. This means that the tangent spaces at each point are canonically identified with each other and with the vector space itself. This explains how the right hand side of the above equation can be employed directly, without regard to spacetime point the metric is to be evaluated and from where (which tangent space) the vectors come from.

This situation changes in [[general relativity]]. There one has

:&lt;math&gt;g(p)_{\mu\nu} \left.dx^\mu\right|_p \left.dx^\nu\right|_p(a, b) = g(p)_{\mu\nu} a^\mu b^\nu,&lt;/math&gt;

where now {{math|''η'' → ''g''(''p'')}}, i.e. {{mvar|g}} is still a metric tensor but now depending on spacetime and is a solution of [[Einstein's field equation]]s. Moreover, {{math|''a'', ''b''}} ''must'' be tangent vectors at spacetime point {{mvar|p}} and can no longer be moved around freely.
{{Hidden end}}

===Chronological and causality relations===

Let {{math|''x'', ''y'' ∈ ''M''}}. We say that

# {{math|''x''}} '''chronologically precedes''' {{math|''y''}} if {{math|''y'' − ''x''}} is future-directed timelike. This relation has the [[transitive property]] and so can be written {{math|''x'' &lt; ''y''}}. 
# {{math|''x''}} '''causally precedes''' {{math|''y''}} if {{math|''y'' − ''x''}} is future-directed null or future-directed timelike. It gives a [[partial ordering]] of spacetime and so can be written {{math|''x'' ≤ ''y''}}.

Suppose ''x'' ∈ ''M'' is timelike. Then the '''simultaneous hyperplane''' for x is &lt;math&gt;\{y : \eta(x, y) = 0\}.&lt;/math&gt; Since this [[hyperplane]] varies as ''x'' varies, there is a [[relativity of simultaneity]] in Minkowski space.

== Generalizations ==
{{main|Lorentzian manifold|Super Minkowski space}}
A Lorentzian manifold is a generalization of Minkowski space in two ways. The total number of spacetime dimensions is not restricted to be  {{math|4}} ({{math|2}} or more) and a Lorentzian manifold need not be flat, i.e. it allows for curvature.

=== Generalized Minkowski space ===
Minkowski space refers to a mathematical formulation in four dimensions. However, the mathematics can easily be extended or simplified to create an analogous generalized Minkowski space in any number of dimensions. If {{math|''n'' ≥ 2}}, {{math|''n''}}-dimensional Minkowski space is a vector space of real dimension {{math|''n''}} on which there is a constant Minkowski metric of signature {{math|(''n'' − 1, 1)}} or {{math|(1, ''n'' − 1)}}. These generalizations are used in theories where spacetime is assumed to have more or less than {{math|4}} dimensions. [[String theory]] and [[M-theory]] are two examples where {{math|''n'' &gt; 4}}. In string theory, there appears [[conformal field theory|conformal field theories]] with {{math|1 + 1}} spacetime dimensions.

[[de Sitter space]] can be formulated as a submanifold of generalized Minkowski space as can the model spaces of [[hyperbolic geometry]] (see below).

=== Curvature ===
As a ''flat spacetime'', the three spatial components of Minkowski spacetime always obey the [[Pythagorean Theorem]]. Minkowski space is a suitable basis for [[special relativity]], a good description of physical systems over finite distances in systems without significant [[gravitation]]. However, in order to take gravity into account, physicists use the theory of [[general relativity]], which is formulated in the mathematics of a [[non-Euclidean geometry]]. When this geometry is used as a model of physical space, it is known as [[curved space]].

Even in curved space, Minkowski space is still a good description in an [[Local reference frame|infinitesimal region]] surrounding any point (barring gravitational singularities).&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This similarity between flat and curved space at infinitesimally small distance scales is foundational to the definition of a [[manifold]] in general.&lt;/ref&gt; More abstractly, we say that in the presence of gravity spacetime is described by a curved 4-dimensional [[manifold]] for which the [[tangent space]] to any point is a 4-dimensional Minkowski space. Thus, the structure of Minkowski space is still essential in the description of general relativity.

== Geometry ==
{{main|Hyperboloid model}}

The meaning of the term ''geometry'' for the Minkowski space depends heavily on the context. Minkowski space is not endowed with a Euclidean geometry, and not with any of the generalized Riemannian geometries with intrinsic curvature, those exposed by the ''model spaces'' in [[hyperbolic geometry]] (negative curvature) and the geometry modeled by the [[sphere]] (positive curvature). The reason is the indefiniteness of the Minkowski metric. Minkowski space is, in particular, not a [[metric space]] and not a Riemannian manifold with a Riemannian metric. However, Minkowski space contains [[submanifold]]s endowed with a Riemannian metric yielding hyperbolic geometry.

Model spaces of hyperbolic geometry of low dimension, say {{math|2}} or {{math|3}}, ''cannot'' be isometrically embedded in Euclidean space with one more dimension, i.e. {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} or {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} respectively, with the Euclidean metric {{math|{{overline|''g''}}}}, disallowing easy visualization.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;There ''is'' an isometric embedding into {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} according to the [[Nash embedding theorem]] ({{harvtxt|Nash|1956}}), but the embedding dimension is much higher, {{math|''n'' {{=}} (''m''/2)(''m'' + 1)(3''m'' + 11)}} for a Riemannian manifold of dimension {{mvar|m}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|1997|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, model spaces with positive curvature are just spheres in Euclidean space of one higher dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|1997|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; It turns out however that these hyperbolic spaces ''can'' be isometrically embedded in spaces of one more dimension when the embedding space is endowed with the Minkowski metric {{math|''η''}}.

Define {{math|'''H'''{{su|p=1(''n'')|b=''R''}} ⊂ '''M'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;}} to be the upper sheet ({{math|''ct'' &gt; 0}}) of the [[hyperboloid]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf H_R^{1(n)} = \left\{\left(ct, x^1, \ldots, x^n\right) \in \mathbf M^n: c^2 t^2 - \left(x^1\right)^2 \cdots \left(x^n\right)^2 = R^2, ct &gt; 0\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

in generalized Minkowski space {{math|'''M'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;}} of spacetime dimension {{math|''n'' + 1}}. This is one of the [[Lorentz group#Restricted Lorentz group|surfaces of transitivity]] of the generalized Lorentz group. The [[induced metric]] on this submanifold,

:&lt;math&gt;h_R^{1(n)} = \iota^* \eta,&lt;/math&gt;

the [[Pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] of the Minkowski metric {{math|''η''}} under inclusion, is a [[Riemannian metric]]. With this metric {{math|'''H'''{{su|p=1(''n'')|b=''R''}}}} is a [[Riemannian manifold]]. It is one of the model spaces of Riemannian geometry, the [[hyperboloid model]] of [[hyperbolic space]]. It is a space of constant negative curvature {{math|−1/''R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{math|1}} in the upper index refers to an enumeration of the different model spaces of hyperbolic geometry, and the {{math|''n''}} for its dimension. A {{math|2(2)}} corresponds to the [[Poincaré disk model]], while {{math|3(''n'')}} corresponds to the [[Poincaré half-plane model|Poincaré half-space model]] of dimension {{math|''n''}}.

=== Preliminaries ===
In the definition above {{math|''ι'': '''H'''{{su|p=1(''n'')|b=''R''}} → '''M'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the [[inclusion map]] and the superscript star denotes the [[Pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]]. The present purpose is to describe this and similar operations as a preparation for the actual demonstration that {{math|'''H'''{{su|p=1(''n'')|b=''R''}}}} actually is a hyperbolic space.

! Behavior of tensors under inclusion, pullback of covariant tensors under general maps and pushforward of vectors under general maps
|-
|
'''Behavior of tensors under inclusion:'''&lt;br/&gt;
For inclusion maps from a submanifold {{mvar|S}} into {{mvar|M}} and a covariant tensor {{mvar|α}} of order {{mvar|k}} on {{mvar|M}} it holds that

:&lt;math&gt;\iota^*\alpha\left(X_1,\, X_2,\, \ldots,\, X_k\right) = \alpha\left(\iota_* X_1,\, \iota_*X_2,\, \ldots,\, \iota_* X_k\right) = \alpha\left(X_1,\, X_2,\, \ldots,\, X_k\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} are vector fields on {{mvar|S}}. The subscript star denotes the pushforward (to be introduced later), and it is in this special case simply the identity map (as is the inclusion map). The latter equality holds because a tangent space to a submanifold at a point is in a canonical way a subspace of the tangent space of the manifold itself at the point in question. One may simply write

:&lt;math&gt;\iota^*\alpha = \alpha|_S,&lt;/math&gt;

meaning (with slight [[abuse of notation]]) the restriction of {{mvar|α}} to accept as input vectors tangent to some {{math|''s'' ∈ ''S''}} only.

'''Pullback of tensors under general maps:'''&lt;br/&gt;
The pullback of a covariant {{mvar|k}}-tensor {{mvar|α}} (one taking only contravariant vectors as arguments) under a map {{math|''F'': ''M'' → ''N''}} is a linear map

:&lt;math&gt;F^*\colon T_{F(p)}^k N \rightarrow T_p^k M,&lt;/math&gt;

where for any vector space {{mvar|V}},

:&lt;math&gt;T^k V = \underbrace{V^* \otimes V^* \otimes \cdots \otimes V^*}_{k\text{ times}}.&lt;/math&gt;

It is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;F^*(\alpha)\left(X_1,\, X_2,\, \ldots,\, X_k\right) = \alpha\left(F_* X_1,\, F_*X_2,\, \ldots,\, F_* X_k\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where the subscript star denotes the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]] of the map {{mvar|F}}, and {{math|''X''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''X''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, …, X&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are vectors in {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}}. (This is in accord with what was detailed about the pullback of the inclusion map. In the general case here, one cannot proceed as simply because {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} in general.)

'''The pushforward of vectors under general maps:'''&lt;br/&gt;
Heuristically, pulling back a tensor to {{math|''p'' ∈ ''M''}} from {{math|''F''(''p'') ∈ ''N''}} feeding it vectors residing at {{math|''p'' ∈ ''M''}} is by definition the same as pushing forward the vectors from {{math|''p'' ∈ ''M''}} to {{math|''F''(''p'') ∈ ''N''}} feeding them to the tensor residing at {{math|''F(''p'') ∈ ''N''}}.

Further unwinding the definitions, the pushforward {{math|F&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;: ''TM''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''TN''&lt;sub&gt;''F''(''p'')&lt;/sub&gt;}} of a vector field under a map {{math|''F'': ''M'' → ''N''}} between manifolds is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;F_*(X)f = X(f \circ F),&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|f}} is a function on {{mvar|N}}. When {{math|''M'' {{=}} ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''N''{{=}} ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} the pushforward of {{mvar|F}} reduces to {{math|''DF'': ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; →  ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the ordinary [[Total derivative#The total derivative as a linear map|differential]], which is given by the [[Jacobian matrix]] of partial derivatives of the component functions. The differential is the best linear approximation of a function {{mvar|F}} from {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}} to {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The pushforward is the smooth manifold version of this. It acts between tangent spaces, and is in coordinates represented by the Jacobian matrix of the ''coordinate representation'' of the function.

The corresponding pullback is the [[Transpose of a linear map|dual map]] from the dual of the range tangent space to the dual of the domain tangent space, i.e. it is a linear map,

:&lt;math&gt;F^*\colon T^*_{F(p)}N \rightarrow T^*_p M.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Hyperbolic stereographic projection ===
[[File:HyperboloidProjection.png|thumb|right|Red circular arc is geodesic in [[Poincaré disk model]]; it projects to the brown geodesic on the green hyperboloid.]]
In order to exhibit the metric it is necessary to pull it back via a suitable ''parametrization''. A parametrization of a submanifold {{mvar|''S''}} of {{math|''M''}} is a map {{math|''U'' ⊂ ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; → ''M''}} whose range is an open subset of {{math|''S''}}. If {{mvar|S}} has the same dimension as {{math|''M''}}, a parametrization is just the inverse of a coordinate map {{math|''φ'': ''M'' → ''U'' ⊂ ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The parametrization to be used is the inverse of ''hyperbolic stereographic projection''. This is illustrated in the figure to the left for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2}}. It is instructive to compare to [[stereographic projection]] for spheres.

Stereographic projection {{math|''σ'': '''H'''{{su|p=''n''|b=''R''}} → ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and its inverse {{math|''σ''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;: ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''H'''{{su|p=''n''|b=''R''}}}} are given by

{{Equation box 1

Let

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf H_R^n = \left\{\left(\tau, x^1, \ldots, x^n\right) \subset \mathbf M: -\tau^2 + \left(x^1\right)^2 + \cdots + \left(x^n\right)^2 = -R^2, \tau &gt; 0\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

and let

:&lt;math&gt;S = (-1, 0, \ldots, 0)&lt;/math&gt;

If

:&lt;math&gt;P = \left(\tau, x^1, \ldots, x^n\right) \in \mathbf H_R^n,&lt;/math&gt;

then it is geometrically clear that the vector

:&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{PS}&lt;/math&gt;

intersects the hyperplane

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{\left(\tau, x^1, \ldots, x^n\right) \in M: \tau = 0\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

once in point denoted

:&lt;math&gt;U = \left(0, u^1(P), \ldots, u^n(P)\right) \equiv (0, \mathbf u).&lt;/math&gt;

One has

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  S + \overrightarrow{SU} &amp;= U \Rightarrow \overrightarrow{SU} = U - S,\\
  S + \overrightarrow{SP} &amp;= P \Rightarrow \overrightarrow{SP} = U - P
\end{align}.&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \overrightarrow{SU} &amp;= (0, \mathbf u) - (-R, 0) = (R, \mathbf u),\\
  \overrightarrow{SP} &amp;= (\tau, \mathbf x) - (-R, 0) = (\tau + R, \mathbf x).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

By construction of stereographic projection one has

:&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{SU} = \lambda(\tau)\overrightarrow{SP}.&lt;/math&gt;

This leads to the system of equations

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
          R &amp;= \lambda(\tau + R),\\
  \mathbf u &amp;= \lambda \mathbf x.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The first of these is solved for &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and one obtains for stereographic projection

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(\tau, \mathbf x) = \mathbf u = \frac{R\mathbf x}{R + \tau}.&lt;/math&gt;

Next, the inverse &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{-1}(u) = (\tau, \mathbf x)&lt;/math&gt; must be calculated. Use the same considerations as before, but now with
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  U &amp;= (0, \mathbf u)\\
  P &amp;= (\tau(\mathbf u), \xi(\mathbf u)).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

One gets

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       \tau &amp;= \frac{R(1 - \lambda)}{\lambda},\\
  \mathbf x &amp;= \frac{\mathbf u}{\lambda},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

but now with &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; depending on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf u.&lt;/math&gt; The condition for {{mvar|P}} lying in the hyperboloid is

:&lt;math&gt;-\tau^2 + \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf u = -\tau^2 + |u|^2 = -R^2,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{R^2(1 - \lambda)^2}{\lambda^2} = \frac{|u|^2}{\lambda^2},&lt;/math&gt;

leading to

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{R^2 - |u|^2}{2R^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

With this &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, one obtains

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^{-1}(\mathbf u) = (\tau, \mathbf x) = \left(R\frac{R^2 + |u|^2}{R^2 - |u|^2}, \frac{2R^2\mathbf u}{R^2 - |u|^2}.\right)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Pulling back the metric ===
One has

:&lt;math&gt;h_R^{1(n)} = \eta|_{\mathbf H_R^{1(n)}} = \left(dx^1\right)^2 + \ldots + \left(dx^n\right)^2 - d\tau^2&lt;/math&gt;

and the map

:&lt;math&gt;
  \sigma^{-1}:\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbf{H}_R^{1(n)};\quad
  \sigma^{-1}(\mathbf{u}) = (\tau(\mathbf{u}),\, \mathbf{x}(\mathbf{u})) = \left(R\frac{R^2 + |u|^2}{R^2 - |u|^2},\, \frac{2R^2\mathbf{u}}{R^2 - |u|^2}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The pulled back metric can be obtained by straightforward methods of calculus;

:&lt;math&gt;
  \left.\left(\sigma^{-1}\right)^* \eta\right|_{\mathbf H_R^{1(n)}} =
  \left(dx^1(\mathbf u)\right)^2 + \ldots + \left(dx^n(\mathbf u)\right)^2 - \left(d\tau(\mathbf u)\right)^2.
&lt;/math&gt;

One computes according to the standard rules for computing differentials (though one is really computing the rigorously defined exterior derivatives),

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  dx^1(\mathbf u) &amp;= d\left(\frac{2R^2 u^1}{R^2 - |u|^2}\right)
                   = \frac{\partial}{\partial u^1}\frac{2R^2 u^1}{R^2 - |u|^2}du^1 + \ldots +
                       \frac{\partial}{\partial u^n}\frac{2R^2 u^1}{R^2 - |u|^2}du^n +
                       \frac{\partial}{\partial\tau}\frac{2R^2 u^1}{R^2 - |u|^2}d\tau,\\
                   &amp;\ \ \vdots\\
   dx^n(\mathbf u) &amp;= d\left(\frac{2R^2 u^n}{R^2 - |u|^2}\right) = \cdots,\\
  d\tau(\mathbf u) &amp;= d\left(R\frac{R^2 + |u|^2}{R^2 - |u|^2}\right) = \cdots,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and substitutes the results into the right hand side. This yields

{{Equation box 1
 |indent =:
 |equation = &lt;math&gt;
  \left(\sigma^{-1}\right)^* h_R^{1(n)} =
  \frac{4R^2 \left[\left(du^1\right)^2 + \ldots + \left(du^n\right)^2\right]}{\left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^2} \equiv
  h_R^{2(n)}.

One has

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial u^1}\frac{2R^2 u^1}{R^2 - |u|^2}du^1 &amp;= \frac{2\left(R^2 -|u|^2\right) + 4R^2 \left(u^1\right)^2}{\left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^2}du^1, \\
  \frac{\partial}{\partial u^2}\frac{2R^2 u^1}{R^2 - |u|^2}du^2 &amp;= \frac{4R^2 u^1 u^2 du^2}{\left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^2}du^2,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial \tau}\frac{2R^2 u^1}{R^2 - |u|^2}d\tau^2 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

With this one may write

:&lt;math&gt;dx^1(\mathbf u) = \frac{2R^2 \left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)du^1 + 4R^2 u^1(\mathbf u \cdot d\mathbf u)}{\left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^2},&lt;/math&gt;

from which

:&lt;math&gt;
  \left(dx^1(\mathbf{u})\right)^2 =
  \frac{4R^2 \left(r^2 - |u|^2\right)^2 \left(du^1\right)^2 +
          16R^4 \left(R^2 - |u|^2\right) \left(\mathbf{u} \cdot d\mathbf{u}\right) u^1 du^1 +
          14R^r \left(u^1\right)^2 \left(\mathbf{u} \cdot d\mathbf{u}\right)^2}
       {\left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^4}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Summing this formula one obtains

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      &amp;\left(dx^1(\mathbf u)\right)^2 + \ldots + \left(dx^n(\mathbf u)\right)^2 \\
  ={} &amp;\frac{4R^2 \left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^2 \left[\left(du^1\right)^2 + \ldots + \left(du^n\right)^2\right] +
             16R^4 \left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)(\mathbf u \cdot d\mathbf u)(\mathbf u \cdot d\mathbf u) +
             16R^4 |u|^2 (\mathbf u \cdot d\mathbf u)^2}
            {\left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^4} \\
  ={} &amp;\frac{4R^2 \left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^2 \left[\left(du^1\right)^2 + \ldots + \left(du^n\right)^2\right]}{\left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^4} +
       R^2 \frac{16R^4 (\mathbf u \cdot d\mathbf u)}{\left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^4}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, for {{mvar|τ}} one gets

:&lt;math&gt;
  d\tau = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial}{\partial u^i} R\frac{R^2 + |u|^2}{R^2 + |u|^2}du^i + \frac{\partial}{\partial\tau}R\frac{R^2 + |u|^2}{R^2 + |u|^2}d\tau
        = \sum_{i=1}^n R^4\frac{4R^2 u^idu^i}{\left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)},
&lt;/math&gt;

yielding

:&lt;math&gt;
  -dt^2 = -\left(R\frac{4R^4\left(\mathbf u \cdot d\mathbf u\right)}{\left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^2}\right)^2
        = -R^2\frac{14R^4(\mathbf u \cdot d\mathbf u)^2}{\left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^4}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Now add this contribution to finally get

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\sigma^{-1}\right)^* h_R^{1(n)} = \frac{4R^2\left[\left(du^1\right)^2 + \ldots + \left(du^n\right)^2\right]}{\left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^2} \equiv h_R^{2(n)}.&lt;/math&gt;
|}

This last equation shows that the metric on the ball is identical to the Riemannian metric {{math|''h''{{su|p=2(''n'')|b=''R''}}}} in the [[Poincaré ball model]], another standard model of hyperbolic geometry.

! Alternative calculation using the pushforward

|
The pullback can be computed in a different fashion. By definition,

:&lt;math&gt;
  \left(\sigma^{-1}\right)^* h_R^{1(n)}(V,\, V) =
  h_R^{1(n)}\left(\left(\sigma^{-1}\right)_* V,\, \left(\sigma^{-1}\right)_* V\right) =
  \eta|_{\mathbf H_R^{1(n)}} \left(\left(\sigma^{-1}\right)_* V,\, \left(\sigma^{-1}\right)_* V\right).
&lt;/math&gt;

In coordinates,
:&lt;math&gt;
    \left(\sigma^{-1}\right)_* V
  = \left(\sigma^{-1}\right)_* V^i\frac{\partial}{\partial u^i}
  = V^i\frac{\partial x^j}{\partial u^i}\frac{\partial}{\partial x^j} +
    V^i\frac{\partial\tau}{\partial u^i}\frac{\partial}{\partial\tau}
  = V^i\frac{\partial}x^j{\partial u^i}\frac{\partial}{\partial x^j} +
    V^i\frac{\partial}\tau{\partial u^i}\frac{\partial}{\partial\tau}
  = Vx^j\frac{\partial}{\partial x^j} + V\tau\frac{\partial}{\partial\tau}.
&lt;/math&gt;

One has from the formula for {{math|''σ''&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;}}

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
   Vx^j &amp;= V^i\frac{\partial}{\partial u^i}\left(\frac{2R^2 u^j}{R^2 - |u|^2}\right)
         = \frac{2R^2 V^j}{R^2 - |u|^2} - \frac{4R^2 u^j\langle\mathbf{V},\, \mathbf{u}\rangle}{\left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^2},\quad
             \left(\text{here } V|u|^2 = 2\sum_{k=1}^n V^k u^k \equiv 2\langle\mathbf{V},\, \mathbf{u}\rangle\right) \\
  V\tau &amp;= V\left(R\frac{R^2 + |u|^2}{R^2 - |u|^2}\right)
         = \frac{4R^3\langle\mathbf{V},\, \mathbf{u}\rangle}{\left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^2}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Lastly,

:&lt;math&gt;
  \eta\left(\sigma_*^{-1}V,\, \sigma_*^{-1}V\right) =
  \sum_{j=1}^n\left(Vx^j\right)^2 - (V\tau)^2 =
  \frac{4R^4 |V|^2}{\left(R^2 - |u|^2\right)^2} =
  h_R^{2(n)}(V,z, V),
&lt;/math&gt;

and the same conclusion is reached.

      <text bytes="2363" xml:space="preserve">In [[geometry]], the '''link''' of a [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]] of a 2-[[dimension]]al [[simplicial complex]] is a [[Graph theory|graph]] that encodes information about the local structure of the complex at the vertex.

It is a [[Graph theory|graph-theoretic]] analog to a sphere centered at a point.

==Definition==
[[File:Tetrahedron.svg|thumb|The [[tetrahedron]] is a 2-complex.]]
[[File:Graphe complet K3.png|thumb|The link of a vertex of a tetrahedron is the triangle.]]
Let {{mvar|X}} be a simplicial complex. The '''link of a vertex''' {{mvar|v}} is the graph {{math|Lk(''v'', ''X'')}} constructed as follows. &amp;nbsp;The vertices of {{math|Lk(''v'', ''X'')}} are precisely the edges of {{mvar|X}} incident to {{mvar|v}}. &amp;nbsp;Two such edges are [[Adjacent (graph theory)|adjacent]] in {{math|Lk(''v'', ''X'')}} [[iff]] they are [[Incidence (geometry)|incident]] to a common 2-cell at {{mvar|v}}.  

The graph {{math|Lk(''v'', ''X'')}} is often given the [[topology]] of a [[ball (mathematics)|ball]] of small radius centred at {{mvar|v}}.

Similarly, for an [[abstract simplicial complex]] and a face {{mvar|F}} of {{mvar|X}}, there is also a notion of the '''link of a face''' {{mvar|F}}, denoted {{math|Lk(''F'', ''X'')}}. &amp;nbsp;{{math|Lk(''F'', ''X'')}} is the set of faces {{mvar|G}} such that 
:&lt;math&gt;G\cap F=\emptyset\text{ and }G\cup F\in X&lt;/math&gt;. 
Because {{mvar|X}} is simplicial, there is a [[bijection|set isomorphism]] between {{math|Lk(''F'', ''X'')}} and 
:&lt;math&gt;X_F = \{G \in X\text{ such that }F \subset G\}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Examples ==
The link of a vertex of a tetrahedron is a triangle – the three vertices of the link corresponds to the three edges incident to the vertex, and the three edges of the link correspond to the faces incident to the vertex. In this example, the link can be visualized by cutting off the vertex with a plane; formally, intersecting the tetrahedron with a plane near the vertex – the resulting cross-section is the link.

      <text bytes="2861" xml:space="preserve">[[File:Equichordal-center.svg|thumb|Curve (red) with two chords (black), intersecting in the equichordal point.]]
In [[geometry]], an '''equichordal point''' is a point defined relative to a [[Convex set|convex]] plane curve such that all [[Chord (geometry)|chords]] passing through the point are equal in length. Two common figures with equichordal points are the [[circle]] and the [[limaçon]].  It is impossible for a curve to have more than one equichordal point.

==Equichordal curves==
A curve is called equichordal when it has an equichordal point.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Multiple equichordal points==
{{main|equichordal point problem}}
In 1916 Fujiwara proposed the question of whether a curve could have two equichordal points (offering in the same paper a proof that three or more is impossible). Independently, a year later, Blaschke, Rothe and Weitzenböck posed the same question.&lt;ref&gt;W. Blaschke, W. Rothe, and R. Weitztenböck. Aufgabe 552. Arch. Math. Phys., 27:82, 1917.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem remained unsolved until it was finally proven impossible in 1996 by [[Marek Rychlik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In [[mathematics]], a '''quasisymmetric''' [[homeomorphism]] between metric spaces is a map that generalizes [[lipschitz function|bi-Lipschitz]] maps. While bi-Lipschitz maps shrink or expand the diameter of a set by no more than a multiplicative factor, quasisymmetric maps satisfy the weaker geometric property that they preserve the relative sizes of sets: if two sets ''A'' and ''B'' have diameters ''t'' and are no more than distance ''t'' apart, then the ratio of their sizes changes by no more than a multiplicative constant. These maps are also related to [[quasiconformal]] maps, since in many circumstances they are in fact equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Heinonen| first = Juha | title = Lectures on Analysis on Metric Spaces | series = Universitext | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = New York | year = 2001 | pages = x+140 | isbn = 978-0-387-95104-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

Let (''X'',&amp;nbsp;''d''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''Y'',&amp;nbsp;''d''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;) be two [[metric space]]s. A [[homeomorphism]] ''f'':''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''Y'' is said to be '''η-quasisymmetric''' if there is an increasing function ''η''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;∞)&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;∞) such that for any triple ''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'',&amp;nbsp;''z'' of distinct points in ''X'', we have

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d_Y(f(x),f(y))}{d_{Y}(f(x),f(z))} \leq \eta\left(\frac{d_X(x,y)}{d_X(x,z)}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

==Basic properties==

; Inverses are quasisymmetric : If ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''Y'' is an invertible ''η''-quasisymmetric map as above, then its inverse map is &lt;math&gt;\eta'&lt;/math&gt;-quasisymmetric, where &lt;math&gt;\eta'&lt;/math&gt;(''t'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/''η''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(1/''t'').
; Quasisymmetric maps preserve relative sizes of sets : If ''A'' and ''B'' are subsets of ''X'' and ''A'' is a subset of ''B'', then
:: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2\eta(\frac{\text{diam }A}{\text{diam }B})}\leq \frac{\text{diam }f(B)}{\text{diam }f(A)}\leq \eta\left(\frac{2\text{diam }B}{\text{diam }A}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==

===Weakly quasisymmetric maps===

A map ''f:X→Y'' is said to be '''H-weakly-quasisymmetric''' for some ''H''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 if for all triples of distinct points ''x,y,z'' in ''X'', we have
:&lt;math&gt; |f(x)-f(y)|\leq H|f(x)-f(z)|\;\;\;\text{ whenever }\;\;\; |x-y|\leq |x-z|&lt;/math&gt;

Not all weakly quasisymmetric maps are quasisymmetric. However, if ''X'' is [[Connected space|connected]] and ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[doubling measures and metric spaces|doubling]], then all weakly quasisymmetric maps are quasisymmetric. The appeal of this result is that proving weak-quasisymmetry is much easier than proving quasisymmetry directly, and in many natural settings the two notions are equivalent.

===δ-monotone maps===

A [[Monotone map#Monotonicity in functional analysis|monotone map]] ''f'':''H''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''H'' on a [[Hilbert space]] ''H'' is '''δ-monotone''' if for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''H'',
:&lt;math&gt; \langle f(x)-f(y),x-y\rangle\geq \delta |f(x)-f(y)|\cdot|x-y|.&lt;/math&gt;

To grasp what this condition means geometrically, suppose ''f''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and consider the above estimate when ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. Then it implies that the angle between the vector ''x'' and its image ''f''(''x'') stays between 0 and arccos&amp;nbsp;''δ''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''π''/2.

These maps are quasisymmetric, although they are a much narrower subclass of quasisymmetric maps. For example, while a general quasisymmetric map in the complex plane could map the real line to a set of [[Hausdorff dimension]] strictly greater than one, a ''δ''-monotone will always map the real line to a rotated [[Graph of a function|graph]] of a Lipschitz function ''L'':ℝ&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;ℝ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kovalev | first = Leonid V. | title= Quasiconformal geometry of monotone mappings | journal = Journal of the London Mathematical Society | volume = 75 | year = 2007 | number = 2 | pages = 391–408 | doi=10.1112/jlms/jdm008| citeseerx = 10.1.1.194.2458 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doubling measures==

===The real line===

Quasisymmetric homeomorphisms of the [[real line]] to itself can be characterized in terms of their derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Beurling | first = A. |author2=Ahlfors, L. |authorlink2=Lars Ahlfors  | title = The boundary correspondence under quasiconformal mappings | journal = Acta Math. | volume=  96 | year = 1956 | pages = 125–142| doi=10.1007/bf02392360| doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; An increasing homeomorphism ''f'':ℝ&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;ℝ is quasisymmetric if and only if there is a constant ''C''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 and  a [[doubling measures and metric spaces|doubling measure]] ''μ'' on the real line such that

:&lt;math&gt; f(x)=C+\int_0^x \, d\mu(t).&lt;/math&gt;

===Euclidean space===

An analogous result holds in Euclidean space. Suppose ''C''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and we rewrite the above equation for ''f'' as 
:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{R}}\left(\frac{x-t}{|x-t|}+\frac{t}{|t|}\right)d\mu(t).&lt;/math&gt;

Writing it this way, we can attempt to define a map using this same integral, but instead integrate (what is now a vector valued integrand) over ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;: if ''μ'' is a doubling measure on ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt; \int_{|x|&gt;1}\frac{1}{|x|}\,d\mu(x)&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;
then the map
:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}\left(\frac{x-y}{|x-y|}+\frac{y}{|y|}\right)\,d\mu(y)&lt;/math&gt;
is quasisymmetric (in fact, it is ''δ''-monotone for some ''δ'' depending on the measure ''μ'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Kovalev | first = Leonid | last2 = Maldonado | first2 =  Diego | last3 = Wu | first3 = Jang-Mei | author3-link= Jang-Mei Wu | title = Doubling measures, monotonicity, and quasiconformality |journal= Math.

==Quasisymmetry and quasiconformality in Euclidean space==

Let ''Ω'' and ''Ω´'' be open subsets of ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. If ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;Ω&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;Ω´ is ''η''-quasisymmetric, then it is also ''K''-[[quasiconformal]], where ''K''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 is a constant depending on ''η''.

Conversely, if ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;Ω&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;Ω´ is ''K''-quasiconformal and ''B''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;2''r'') is contained in ''Ω'', then ''f'' is ''η''-quasisymmetric on ''B''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''r''), where ''η'' depends only on&amp;nbsp;''K''.

[[File:Wittgenstein rod.svg|thumb|right|200px|An asymmetric case produced by a long rod]]
'''Wittgenstein's rod''' is a geometry problem discussed by 20th-century philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].

==Description==
A [[Ray (geometry)|ray]] is drawn with its  origin 'A' on a circle, through an external point ''S'' and a point ''B'' is chosen at some constant distance from the starting end of the ray; what figure does ''B'' describe when all the initial points on the circle are considered? The answer depends on three parameters: the radius of the circle, the distance from the center to ''S'' and the length of the segment ''AB''. The shape described by ''B'' can be seen as a  'figure of eight' which in some cases degenerates to a single lobe looking like  an [[Inverse curve|invert]]ed [[cardioid]].

If ''B'' remains on the same side of ''S'' with respect to the center of the circle, instead of a ray one can consider just a [[Line segment|segment]] or the [[Rod (geometry)|rod]] 'AB'.

Wittgenstein sketched a mechanism and wrote:
{{blockquote|While the point A describes a circle, B describes a figure eight. Now we write this down as a proposition of kinematics.
When I work the mechanism its movement proves the proposition to me; as would a construction on paper.
The proposition corresponds e.g. to a picture of the mechanism with the paths of the points A and B drawn in. Thus it is in a certain respect a picture of that movement. It holds fast what the proof shows me. Or - what it persuades me of.}}

'''Strähle's construction''' is a [[geometry|geometric]] method for determining the lengths for a series of [[vibrating string]]s with uniform diameters and tensions to sound [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] in a specific rational [[Musical temperament|tempered]] [[musical tuning]]. It was first published in the 1743 ''Proceedings of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]'' by Swedish master [[organ (music)|organ]] maker '''Daniel Stråhle''' (1700–1746). The Academy's secretary Jacob Faggot appended a miscalculated set of pitches to the article, and these figures were reproduced by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg]] in ''Versuch über die musikalische Temperatur'' in 1776. Several German textbooks published about 1800 reported that the mistake was first identified by Christlieb Benedikt Funk in 1779, but the construction itself appears to have received little notice until the middle of the twentieth century when tuning theorist [[J. Murray Barbour]] presented it as a good method for approximating [[equal temperament]] and similar exponentials of small roots, and generalized its underlying mathematical principles.

It has become known as a device for building fretted musical instruments through articles by mathematicians [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] and [[Isaac Jacob Schoenberg]], and is praised by them as a unique and remarkably elegant solution developed by an unschooled craftsman.

The name "Strähle" used in recent English language works appears to be due to a transcription error in Marpurg's text, where the old-fashioned diacritic raised "e" was substituted for the raised ring.&lt;ref name = "marpurg"&gt;Wilhelm Friedrich Marpurg [http://www.mdz-nbn-resolving.de/urn/resolver.pl?urn=urn:nbn:de:bvb:12-bsb10598999-6 ''Versuch über die musikalische Temperatur''] 1776 p.167-168&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Daniel P. Stråhle was active as an organ builder in central Sweden&lt;!--[[Gästrikland]]--&gt; in the second quarter of the eighteenth century. He had worked as a journeyman for the important Stockholm organ builder Johan Niclas Cahman&lt;!--(1675-1735)??--&gt;, and in 1741&lt;!--Norlind says 1742--&gt;, four years after Cahman's death, Stråhle was granted his privilege for organ making. According to the system in force in Sweden at the time a privilege, a granted monopoly which was held by only a few of the most established makers of each type of musical instruments, gave him the legal right to build and repair organs, as well as to train and examine workers, and it also served as a guarantee of the quality of the work and education of the maker.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Helenius-Öberg [http://www.musikforskning.se/stm/STM1977/STM1977_1HeleniusOberg.pdf "Svensk Instrumentmakeri 1720-1800 - En Preliminär Översikt"] ''Svensk Tidskrift för Musikforskning'', 1977 p.22&lt;!--5-43--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; An organ by him from 1743 is preserved in its original condition at the chapel at [[Strömsholm Palace]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalcourt.se/royalcourt/theroyalpalaces/stromsholmpalace/thepalace/history.4.396160511584257f21800017339.html  History: Strömsholm Palace] The Royal Palaces - The Royal Court (accessed October 14, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; he is also known to have made [[clavichord]]s, and a notable example with an unusual string scale and construction signed by him and dated 1738 is owned by the [[Stockholm Music Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward L. Kottick and George Lucktenberg, ''Early Keyboard Instruments in European Museums'' Indiana University Press 1997 p.196&lt;br /&gt;Daniel Stråhle, 1738 [http://www.musikmuseet.se/samlingar/detalj.php?l=sv&amp;iid=172&amp;str= Klavikord, Inv. nr. N145765] - Stockholm Music Museum (accessed August 28, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; His apprentices included his nephew Petter Stråhle and Jonas Gren, partners in the famous Stockholm organ builders Gren &amp; Stråhle,&lt;ref&gt;"Jonas Gren" ''Nordisk Familjebok'' femte band, Gernandts boktryckeri-aktiebolag, Stockholm. 1882 p.1554&lt;/ref&gt; and according to [[Abraham Hülphers|Abraham Abrahamsson Hülphers]] in his book ''Historisk Afhandling om Musik och Instrumenter'' published in 1773, Stråhle himself had studied mechanics (which has been assumed to have included mathematics&lt;ref name = "kerala"&gt;Kerala J. Snyder ''The Organ as a Mirror of its Time: North European Reflections, 1600-2000'' Oxford University Press, 2002 p.8, 15&lt;/ref&gt;) with Swedish Academy of Science founding member [[Christopher Polhem]].&lt;ref name = "norlind"&gt;Tobias Norlind ''Svensk Musikhistoria'' Helsingborgs Typografiska Anstalt, Helsingborg 1901. p.&amp;nbsp;132&lt;!--https://books.google.com/books?id=yyIQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=polhem+orgel&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=5AL9Sq_qD5u0zASZ4LSjDw&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=polhem%20orgel&amp;f=false--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 1746 at Lövstabruk in northern Uppland.

Stråhle published his construction as a "new invention, to determine the ''Temperament'' in tuning, for the pitches of the clavichord and similar instruments" in an article that appeared in the fourth volume of the proceedings of the newly formed Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which included articles by prominent scholars and Academy members Polhem, [[Carl von Linne|Carl Linnaeus]], [[Carl Fredrik Mennander]], [[Augustin Ehrensvärd]], and [[Samuel Klingenstierna]].&lt;!--Jacob Faggot, Göran Wallerius,  and Per Elvius, Daniel Tilas, and scientific instrument maker Daniel Ekström in the same volume--&gt; According to organologist Eva Helenius musical tuning was a subject of intense debate in the Academy during the 1740s,&lt;ref name = "helenius1979"&gt;Eva Helenius-Öberg [http://www.musikforskning.se/stm/STM1979/STM1979_1HeleniusOberg.pdf "Cembalon i Sverige samt Frågan om det Svenska Klavikordets Uppkomst"] ''Svensk Tidskrift för Musikforskning'' 1979 p.31-42&lt;/ref&gt; and though Stråhle himself was not a member his was the third article on practical musical topics published by the Academy—the first two were by amateur musical instrument maker, minister, and Academy member Nils Brelin&lt;ref&gt;"Nils Brelin" ''Nordisk Familjebok'' fjärde bandet Nordisk Familjeboks förlags aktiebolag Stockholm 1905 p.86&lt;/ref&gt; which related inventions applicable to harpsichords and clavichords.&lt;ref&gt;Nils Brelin "Et Påfund at Storligen öka ''Claviers'' och ''Cymbalers'' godhet" ''Kongliga Swenska Wetenskaps Academiens Handlingar'', för Månaderne Julius, August och September 1739 vol. 1, p.81; Nils Brelin "Beskrifning öfver det nyt Påfund af en uprät-stående dubbel Clavesin, inrättad met forte och Piano til 8. graders förändring, som wid 1741. års Riksdag för Riksens Höglofl. Ständer blifwit upwist, af des inventor Nicol. Brelin ''Kongliga Swenska Wetenskaps Academiens Handlingar'', för Månaderne Julius, August och September vol.3 p.218&lt;/ref&gt;

Stråhle wrote in his article that he had developed the method with "some thought and a great number of attempts" for the purpose of creating a gauge for the lengths of the strings in the temperament which he described as that which made the tempering ("sväfningar") mildest for the ear, as well comprising as the most useful and even arrangement of the pitches. His instructions produce an irregular tuning with a range of tempered intervals similar to better known tunings published during the same period, but he provided no further comments or description about the tuning itself; today it is generally considered to be an approximation of [[equal temperament]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbour (1951) p.65&lt;/ref&gt; He also did not elaborate upon any advantages of his construction, which can produce accurate and repeatable results without calculations or measurement with only a straightedge and dividers; he described the construction in only five steps, and it is less iterative than  arithmetic methods described by [[Dom Bédos de Celles]] method for determining organ pipe lengths in just intonation or [[Vincenzo Galilei]] for determining string fret positions in approximate equal temperament, and geometrical methods such as those described by [[Gioseffo Zarlino]] and [[Marin Mersenne]]—all of which are much better known than Stråhle's. Stråhle concluded by stating that he had applied the system to a clavichord, although the tuning as well as the method of determining a set of sounding lengths can be used for many other musical instruments, but there is little evidence showing whether it was put into more widespread practice other than the two examples described in the article, and whose whereabouts today are unknown.

== Construction ==

[[Image:1743Strahle tabvifig4.svg|300px|right]]Stråhle instructed first to draw a line segment ''QR'' of a convenient length divided in twelve equal parts, with points labeled I through XIII. ''QR'' is then used as the base of an isosceles triangle with sides ''OQ'' and ''OR'' twice as long as ''QR'', and rays drawn from vertex ''O'' through each of the numbered points on the base. Finally a line is drawn from vertex ''R'' at an angle through a point ''P'' on the opposite leg of the triangle seven units from ''Q'' to a point ''M'', located at twice the distance from ''R'' as ''P''. The length of ''MR'' gives the length of the lowest sounding pitch, and the length of ''MP'' the highest of the string lengths generated by the construction, and the sounding lengths between them are determined by the distances from ''M'' to the intersections of ''MR'' with lines ''O I'' through ''O XII'', at points labeled 1 through 12.

Stråhle wrote that he had named the line ''PR'' "Linea Musica", which Helenius noted was a term Polhem had used in an undated but earlier manuscript now located at the Linköping Stifts- och Landsbibliotek and which is accompanied by notes from composer and geometer Harald Vallerius (1646–1716) and Stråhle's former employer J. N. Cahman.&lt;ref name = "helenius1979" /&gt;

Stråhle also showed line segments parallel to ''MR'' through points ''NHS'', ''LYT'', and ''KZV'' in order to illustrate how once created the construction could be scaled to accommodate different starting pitches.

Stråhle stated at the conclusion of the article that he had implemented the string scale in the highest three octaves of a clavichord, although it is unclear whether this section would have been strung all with the same gauge wire under equal tension like the monochord which he wrote it resembled, and whose construction he described in more detail. He only described an indirect method of setting its tuning, however, requiring that he first establish reference pitches by transferring the corresponding string lengths to the movable bridges on a keyed thirteen string monochord whose open strings had been previously tuned in unison.{{ref|Strahle285|a}}

== Faggot's numerical representation ==

[[Image:1743Faggot table.png|250px|right]]
The article following Stråhle's was a mathematical treatment of it by '''Jacob Faggot''' (1699–1777), then secretary of the Academy of Sciences and future director of the Surveying Office, who in the same volume also contributed articles on a weight measure for lye&lt;!--"Beskrifning på en i Sverige brukelig Lutvigt" p.239--&gt; and methods for calculating the volume of barrels&lt;!--"Om runda Kärils Rymdemätning'' p.200--&gt;. Faggot was one of the first members of the Academy, and had also been member of a special commission on weights and measures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfbg/0678.html "Jakob Faggot"] ''Nordisk Familjebok'' Band 7, Nordisk familjeboks förlags aktiebolag, Stockholm 1907 p.1259&lt;/ref&gt; He apparently was not a musician, though Helenius described he was interested in musical topics from a mathematical perspective and documented that he periodically came in contact with musical instrument makers through the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Helenius-Öberg [http://musikforskning.se/stm/STM1987/STM1987HeleniusOberg.pdf "Kyrkoherden Nils Brelin—Mechanicus och Klaverälskare"] ''Svensk Tidskrift för Musikforskning'' 1987 p.112&lt;/ref&gt; Helenius also presented a theory that Faggot had a more active, if indirect and posthumous influence on the construction of musical instruments in Sweden, claiming that he may have suggested the long tenor strings used in two experimental instruments built by Johan Broman in 1756 which she proposed influenced the type of clavichord built in Sweden in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;The instruments—a harpsichord and clavichord, both in the Stockholm Music Museum collection—are notable for their extreme large size and long tenor strings, where string length doubling extends down five octaves, and three octaves and a fourth respectively. Both incorporate many of the ideas described by Brelin in an article the Academy's 1739 Proceedings; Helenius (1979)&lt;br /&gt;

In his analysis of Stråhle's article Faggot outlined the trigonometric steps he had used to calculate the sounding lengths of the individual pitches, for the purpose of comparing the new tuning produced by Stråhle's method, against a tuning with pure thirds, fourths and fifths (labeled "N.1." in the table), and equal temperament, which he called only "an older temperament and [which] is introduced in [[Johann Mattheson|Mr. Mattheson's]] ''Critica Musica''" ("N.2."),&lt;!--en äldre _Temperatur_, ock står införd i Herr _Matthesons Critica Musica_, pag. 32,--&gt; He intended the resulting set of figures to show whether "the tuning of the pitches, following the previously described invention, satisfies the ear with pleasant sounds and with better evenness, in the ''Musical'' pitches on a keyboard instrument, and therefore teaches understanding better can judge than the old and previously known manner of tuning, when the eye can see what the ear hears." {{ref|Faggot286|b}}

The sounding lengths calculated by Faggot are substantially different from what would be produced according to Stråhle's instructions, a fact which appears to have been first published by [[:de:Christlieb Benedict Funk|Christlieb Benedict Funk]] in ''Dissertatio de Sono et Tono'' in 1779,&lt;ref&gt;reviewed in "Leipzig" ''Göttingische Anzeigen von gelehrten Sachen unter der Aufsicht der Königl. Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften.'' 32 Stück (11 März, 1780) Erste Band. Johann Christian Dieterich, Göttingen, 1780&lt;!--https://books.google.com/books?id=Ug0WAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA272--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The article reported that the actual tuning was nothing new since it did not differ significantly from the usual division of the octave.&lt;/ref&gt; and the tuning he created includes intervals tuned outside of the range conventionally used in Western art music. Funk is credited the observation of this discrepancy in [[Johann Samuel Traugott Gehler|Gehler]]'s ''Physikalisches Wörterbuch'' in 1791,&lt;ref&gt;''Dissertatio de Sono et Tono''. Leipzig. 1779. 4; cited by Johann Samuel Traugott Gehler "Ton" &lt;!--https://books.google.com/books?id=5qEtAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA387-IA8--&gt;''Physikalisches Wörterbuch oder Versuch einer Erklärung der vornehmsten Begriffe und Kunstwörter der Naturlehre'' Vierter Theil. Schwickertschen Verlage, Leipzig 1791 p.387-388&lt;/ref&gt; and Fischer's ''Physikalisches Wörterbuch'' in 1804,&lt;ref&gt;Johann Carl Fischer "Ton" ''Physikalisches Wörterbuch oder Erklärung der vornehmsten zur Physik'' Fünfter Theil. Heinrich Dieterich, Göttingen 1804 p.26&lt;/ref&gt; and the error was pointed out by [[Ernst Chladni]] in ''Die Akustik'' in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Florens Friedrich Chladni ''Die Akustik'' Breitkopf &amp; Härtel, Leipzig 1830 p.39&lt;/ref&gt; No similar comments appear to have been published in Sweden during the same period.

These works report Faggot's mistake as the result of having used a value from the tangent instead of the sine column from the logarithmic tables. The error itself consisted of making the angle of ''RP'' about seven degrees too great, which caused the effective length of ''QP'' to increase to 8.605. This greatly exaggerated the errors of the temperament compared to the tunings he presented alongside of it, although it is not clear whether Faggot observed these apparent defects as he made no further comments about Stråhle's construction or temperament in the article.

[[Image:1743straahle fifthsandthirdschart.png|thumb|200px|right]]

== The tuning ==

The tuning produced following Stråhle's instructions is a rational temperament with a range of fifths from 696 to 704 cents, which is from about one cent flatter than a [[quarter-comma meantone|meantone]] fifth to two cents sharp of [[Just intonation|just]] 3:2; the range of major thirds is from 396 cents to 404 cents, or ten cents sharp of just 5/4 to three cents flat of [[Pythagorean tuning|Pythagorean]] 81/64. These intervals fall within what is considered to have been acceptable but there is no distribution of better thirds to more frequently used keys that characterize what are today the most popular of the tunings published in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, which are known as ''[[well temperament]]s''. The best fifth is pure in the key of F♯—or the pitch given by ''MB''—which has a 398 cent third, and the best third is in the key E, which has a 697 cent fifth; the best combination of the two intervals is in the key of F and the worst combination is in the key of B♭.

== Barbour's algebraic representation and geometric construction==

J. Murray Barbour brought new attention to Stråhle's construction along with Faggot's treatment of it in the 20th century. Introduced in the context of Marpurg, he included an overview of it alongside the more famous methods of determining string lengths in his 1951 book ''Tuning and Temperament'' where he characterized the tuning as an "approximation for equal temperament". He also demonstrated how close Stråhle's construction was to the best approximation the method could provide, which reduces the maximum errors in major thirds and fifths by about half a cent and is accomplished by substituting 7.028 for the length of ''QP''.

Barbour presented a more complete analysis of the construction in "A Geometrical Approximation to the Roots of Numbers" published six years later in ''American Mathematical Monthly''.&lt;ref&gt;J. Murray Barbour "A Geometrical approximation to the Roots of Numbers" ''American Mathematical Monthly'' vol. 64 (1957) p.1-9&lt;/ref&gt; He reviewed Faggot's error and its consequences, and then derived Stråhle's construction algebraically using [[Similarity (geometry)|similar triangles]]. This takes the generalized form

&lt;math&gt;N^m \doteq \frac{OA + BA + (OA - 3BA) \times{m}}{OA +BA - 2BA\times{m}}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the values from Stråhle's instructions this becomes

&lt;math&gt;\frac{24 + 10m}{24 - 7m}&lt;/math&gt;

Letting &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle OA-BA=1&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle OA+BA=\sqrt{N}&lt;/math&gt; leads to a form of the first formula that is more useful for calculation

&lt;math&gt;N^m \doteq \frac{Nm+\sqrt{N}(1-m)}{m+\sqrt{N}(1-m)}&lt;/math&gt;

   | caption2  = Barbour's (red) and Schoenberg's (blue) methods
  }}

Barbour then described a generalized construction using the easily obtained [[Geometric mean|mean proportional]] for the length of ''MB'' that avoids most of the specific angles and lengths required in the original. For musical applications it is simpler and its results are slightly more uniform than Stråhle's, and it has the advantage of producing the desired string lengths without additional scaling.

He instructed to first draw the line ''MR'' corresponding to the larger of  the two numbers with ''MP'' the smaller, and to construct their mean proportional at ''MB''. The line that will carry the divisions is drawn from ''R'' at any acute angle to ''MR'', and perpendicular to it a line is drawn through ''B'', which intersects the line to be divided at ''A'', and ''RA'' is extended to ''Q'' such that ''RA''=''AQ''. A line is drawn from ''Q'' through ''P'', intersecting the line through ''BA'' at ''O'', and a line drawn from ''O'' to ''R''. The construction is completed by dividing ''QR'' and drawing rays from ''O'' through each of the divisions.

Barbour concluded with a discussion of the pattern and magnitude of the errors produced by the generalized construction when used to approximate exponentials of different roots, stating that his method "is simple and works exceedingly well for small numbers". For roots from 1 to 2 the error is less than 0.13%—about 2 cents when ''N''=2— with maxima around ''m''=0.21 and ''m''=0.79. The error curve appears roughly sinusoidal and for this range of ''N'' can be approximated by about 99% by fitting the curve obtained for ''N''=1, &lt;math&gt;f(m)=m(1-m)(1-2m)&lt;/math&gt;. The error increases rapidly for larger roots, for which Barbour considered the method inappropriate; the error curve resembles the form &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle f(x)=x(1-x^{2a})&lt;/math&gt; with maxima moving closer to ''m''= 0 and ''m''=1 as ''N'' increases.

===Schoenberg's refinements of Barbour's methods===

The paper was published with two notes added by its referee, [[Isaac Jacob Schoenberg]]. He observed that the formula derived by Barbour was a fractional linear transformation and so called for a perspectivity,&lt;!--"the linear fractional transformation clearly called for a perspectivity"--&gt; and that since three pairs of corresponding points on the two lines uniquely determined a projective correspondence&lt;!--"since a projective correspondence on lines is uniquely determined by three pairs of corresponding points,"--&gt; Barbour's condition that ''OA'' be perpendicular to ''QR'' was irrelevant. The omission of this step allows a more convenient selection of length for ''QR'', and reduces the number of operations.

Schoenberg also noted that Barbour's equation could be viewed as an interpolation of the exponential curve through the three points ''m''=0, ''m''=1/2 and ''m''=1, which he expanded upon in a short paper titled "On the Location of the Frets on the Guitar" published in ''American Mathematical Monthly'' in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac J. Schoenberg "On the Location of the Frets on a Guitar" ''American Mathematical Monthly'' vol. 83, 1976 p.550-2.&lt;/ref&gt; This article concluded with a brief discussion of Stråhle's fortuitous use of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac {41}{29}&lt;/math&gt; for the half-octave, which is one of the convergents of the [[Square root of two#Continued fraction representation|continued fraction expansion]] of the &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;, and the best rational approximation of it for the size of the denominator.

===Stewart and continued fractions===

The use of fractional approximations of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; in Stråhle's construction was expanded upon by Ian Stewart, who wrote about the construction in "A Well Tempered Calculator" in his 1992 book ''Another Fine Math You've Got Me Into...'' &lt;ref&gt;Ian Stewart ''Another Fine Math You've Got Me Into...'' Courier Dover Publications, 2004 p.246-252&lt;/ref&gt; as well as "Faggot's Fretful Fiasco" included in ''Music and Mathematics'' published in 2006. Stewart considered the construction from the standpoint of projective geometry, and derived the same formulas as Barbour by treating it from the start as a fractional linear function, of the form &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle y= \frac{(ax+b)}{(cx+d)}&lt;/math&gt;, and he pointed out that the approximation for &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; implicit in the construction is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac {17}{12}&lt;/math&gt;, which is the next lower convergent from the half octave it produces. This is the consequence of the function simplifying to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac{p+2q}{p+q}&lt;/math&gt; for ''m''=0.5 where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac{p}{q}&lt;/math&gt; is the generating approximation.

==Similar methods applied to musical instruments==

The geometric and arithmetic methods for dividing monochords as well as musical instrument fretboards compiled by Barbour were for the stated purpose of illustrating the different tunings each represents or implies, and Schoenberg's and Stewart's works retained similar focus and references. Three textbooks on piano building that are not included by them show similar constructions to Stråhle's for designing new instruments but treat the tuning of their pitches independently; both constructions employ a non-perpendicular form as suggested by Schoenberg's observation in Barbour's "A Geometrical approximation to the Roots of Numbers", and one achieves optimal results while the other demonstrates an application with a root other than 2.

===Kützing===

Carl Kützing, an organ and piano maker in Bern during the middle of the 19th century wrote in his first book on piano design, ''Theoretisch-praktisches Handbuch der Fortepiano-Baukunst'' from 1833, that he devised a simple method of determining the sounding lengths in an octave after reading of the different geometric constructions described in an issue of Marpurg's ''Historisch-kritischen Beitragen zur Aufnahme der Musik'';&lt;!--Moses Mendelsohn, zweyte Aufgave, fuenfte Band--&gt; he stated that the divisions would be very accurate and that the construction could be used for fretting guitars.

Kützing introduced the construction following a description of a large [[sector (instrument)|sector]] to be made for the same purpose. He did not include either method in ''Das Wissenschaftliche der Fortepiano-Baukunst'' published eleven years later, where he calculated lengths using approximately 18:35 ratios between octave lengths and proposed a new method with a non-continuous curve adjusted for actual wire diameters in order to reduce tonal differences from jumps in tension.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Kützing. [https://books.google.com/books?id=2T8uAAAAYAAJ ''Das Wissenschaftliche der Fortepiano-Baukunst'']. J. F. J. Dalp. Bern und Chur, 1844&lt;/ref&gt;

Kützing instructed to extend a line segment ''bc''—representing a known sounding length—at 45 degrees to the line ba, and from its octave at point ''d'' located midway between ''b'' and ''c'', to extend a line perpendicular to ''ba'' intersecting it at ''e'', then to divide ''de'' into 12 equal parts. The point ''a'' on ''ab'' is located by transferring the lengths of ''de'', ''db'', from ''e'' away from ''b'', and rays extended from ''a'' through the points dividing ''de'' and intersecting ''bc'' to locate the different endpoints of the string lengths from ''c''.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Kützing. Theoretisch-praktisches Handbuch der Fortepiano-Baukunst. J. F. J. Dalp. Bern und Chur, 1833. p.20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

This arrangement is equivalent to using the mean proportional to locate ''a''.

A re-labeled diagram with instructions was included in a pamphlet printed by England's largest piano manufacturers [[John Broadwood &amp; Sons]] to accompany their display at the [[1862 International Exhibition]] in London, where they described it as "a practical method of finding the lengths of Strings, for every note of the Octave on equal temperament; so that with wire of the same size the tension on each note shall be the same."&lt;ref&gt;Alastair Laurence. [http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/10949/ ''The Evolution of the Broadwood Grand Piano 1785-1998''] "fig. 6/6: Broadwood's scale design geometry, 1862" University of York Department of Music September 1998, p.151&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was also reproduced, alongside a sector, by Giacomo Sievers, a Russian-born piano maker working in Naples, in his 1868 book ''Il Pianoforte'', where he claimed it was the best practical method for determining sounding lengths of strings in a piano. Like Broadwood, Sievers did not describe its source or extent of its use, and did not explain any theory behind it. He also did not suggest it had any use beyond designing pianos.&lt;ref&gt;Giacomo Sievers, Il Diagramma per lo spartimento delle corde. [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=scores;cc=scores;view=toc;idno=1466882.0001.001 ''Il pianoforte; Guida Pratica per Costruttori, Accordatori, Dilettanti e Possessori di Pianoforti''] Stabilimento Tipografico Ghio, Napoli 1868. p.103-104&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wolfenden===

English piano maker Samuel Wolfenden presented a construction for determining all but the lowest sounding plain string lengths in a piano in ''A Treatise on the Art of Pianoforte Construction'' published in 1916; like Sievers, he did not explain whether this was an original procedure or one in common use, commenting only that it was "a very practical method of determining string lengths, and in past years I used it altogether". He added that at the time of writing he found calculating the lengths directly "somewhat easier" and had preceded the description with a table of computed lengths for the top five octaves of a piano.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Wolfenden, String Lengths and Diameters. ''A Treatise on the Art of Pianoforte Construction'' 1916, reprinted by Unwin Brothers, London, 1975 p.23-33&lt;/ref&gt; He included frequencies in equal temperament, but only published aural tuning instructions in his 1927 supplement.

Wolfenden explicitly advocated equalizing the tension of the plain strings which he proposed to accomplish in the upper range by combining a 9:17 ratio between octave lengths with a uniform change in string diameters (achieving slightly more consistent results over the otherwise similar system published by Siegfried Hansing in 1888&lt;ref&gt;Siegfried Hansing [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_pianoforte_and_its_acoustic_properti.html?id=zNc5AAAAIAAJ ''The Pianoforte and its Acoustic Properties''] second edition, translated by Emmy Hansing-Perzina. Siegfried Hansing, Schwerin i. M., 1904 p.84&lt;/ref&gt;), in contrast to Sievers scale whose stringing schedule results in higher tension for the thicker, lower sounding pitches.

Like Sievers, Wolfenden constructed all of the sounding lengths on a single segment at 45 degrees from the base lines for the rays, starting with points located for each C in the range designed at 54, 102, 192.5, 364 and 688mm from the upper point. The four vertices for the rays are then located by the intersections of the horizontal base lines extended from the lower C in each octave with a second line angled from the upper starting point for the string line, however, which he specified should both be at 51.5 degrees to the base lines and that the base lines have a 35:13 ratio with the difference between the two octave lengths.

Wolfenden's method approximates &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sqrt{17/9}&lt;/math&gt; with roughly &lt;!--&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 17/9-(sin(45)*(17/9)*(1+1/tan(51.5)))/((9/4)*(1+(17/9)/tan(51.5))+1) ~ &lt;/math&gt; (~1.3777)--&gt; 1.3775&lt;!--&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 17/9-(sin(pi/4)/sin(B)+1)*280/117*1/cos(pi/4) ~&lt;/math&gt; (~1.3774)--&gt;, and is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle OA/OB=8.27&lt;/math&gt; in Barbour's form. Compensating for its smaller octaves this produces 596 cent half octaves, an error of about 1mm at note F4 (f&amp;prime;) compared with his calculated figures.

'''Rabatment of the rectangle''' is a compositional technique used as an aid for the placement of objects or the division of space within a rectangular frame, or as an aid for the study of art.

Every rectangle contains two implied squares, each consisting of a short side of the rectangle, an equal length along each longer side, and an imaginary fourth line parallel to the short side. The process of mentally rotating the short sides onto the long ones is called "rabatment", and often the imaginary fourth line is called "the rabatment".

Also known as '''rebatement''' and '''rabattement''', ''rabatment'' means the rotation of a plane into another plane about their line of intersection, as in closing an open hinge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Oxford English Dictionary |year=2003 |edition=2 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In two dimensions, it means to rotate a line about a point until the line coincides with another sharing the same point. The term is used in geometry, art and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Paynter |first=J.E. |title=Practical geometry for builders and architects |year=1921 |location=London |publisher=[[Chapman &amp; Hall]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
There is no absolute explanation of the mechanism of this method, but there are various theories.&lt;ref name=Mize2009/&gt; One argument is that squares are such a simple, primal geometric shape that the brain automatically looks for them, mentally completing this rabatment whether it is made explicit or not. When a composition uses elements of the scene to match, the square feels complete in itself, producing a feeling of harmony.&lt;ref name=Mize2009/&gt;

As one of many composition techniques, rabatment of the rectangle can be used to inform the positioning of elements within the rectangle. There is no hard and fast rule regarding such positioning; a composition can have a sense of dynamic unrest or a sense of equilibrium relative to important lines such as ones taken from rabatment or from the rule of thirds, or from nodal points such as the "eyes of a rectangle"—the four intersections derived from the rule of thirds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.giotto.us/vasari/feltus/composition.html |last=Feltus |first=Alan |title=Painting and Composition |publisher=International School of Painting, Drawing, and Sculpture |location=Umbria, Italy |accessdate=26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary image elements can be positioned within one of the two rabatment squares to define the center of interest, and secondary image elements can be placed outside of a rabatment square.&lt;ref name=Mize2008&gt;{{cite web |url=http://visualcomposing.blogspot.com/2008/07/placing-our-images-rabatment.html |title=Placing Our Images: Rabatment |last=Mize |first=Dianne |work=Compose |date=16 July 2008 |accessdate=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of rabatment can be applied to rectangles of any proportion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FnvsAAAAMAAJ |title=Composing your paintings |last=Dunstan |first=Bernard |pages=22, 26 |publisher=Taplinger Publishing |year=1979 |isbn=0-8008-1803-2 |series=Start To Paint}}&lt;/ref&gt; For rectangles with a 3:2 ratio (as in [[135 film|35mm film]] in still photography), it happens that the rabatment lines are exactly matched to the [[rule of thirds]] lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.watercoloristsofwhatcom.com/glossary.html |title=Glossary |publisher=Watercolorists of Whatcom |last=Brown |first=Scott |year=2009 |accessdate=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a horizontally-aligned rectangle, there is one implied square for the left side and one for the right; for a vertically-aligned rectangle, there are upper and lower squares.&lt;ref name=Mize2009&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emptyeasel.com/2009/01/27/how-to-use-rabatment-in-your-compositions/ |title=How to Use Rabatment in Your Compositions |last=Mize |first=Dianne |work=Empty Easel |date=27 January 2009 |accessdate=26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the long sides of the rectangle are exactly twice the length of the short, this line is right in the middle. With longer-proportioned rectangles, the squares don't overlap, but with shorter-proportioned ones, they do. In [[Western culture]]s that read left to right, attention is often focused inside the left-hand rabatment, or on the line it forms at the right-hand side of the image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.explore-drawing-and-painting.com/composition-art.html |title=Composition in art: Rabatment |publisher=Explore-Drawing-and-Painting.com |last=Nelson |first=Connie |year=2010 |accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When rabatment is used with one side of a [[golden rectangle]], and then iteratively applied to the left-over rectangle, the resulting "whirling rectangles" describe the [[golden spiral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Fairbanks |first1=Avard T. |last2=Fairbanks |first2=Eugene F. |title=Human Proportions for Artists |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RacMqZ-sCDQC&amp;pg=PA210 210] |publisher=Fairbanks Art and Books |year=2005 |isbn=0-9725841-1-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Drini-conjugatehyperbolas.svg|thumb|right|The unit hyperbola is blue, its conjugate is green, and the asymptotes are red.]]
In [[geometry]], the '''unit hyperbola''' is the set of points (''x,y'') in the [[Cartesian plane]] that satisfy the [[implicit equation]] &lt;math&gt; x^2 - y^2 = 1 .&lt;/math&gt; In the study of [[indefinite orthogonal group]]s, the unit hyperbola forms the basis for an ''alternative radial length''
: &lt;math&gt;r = \sqrt {x^2 - y^2} .&lt;/math&gt;
Whereas the [[unit circle]] surrounds its center, the unit hyperbola requires the ''conjugate hyperbola'' &lt;math&gt;y^2 - x^2 = 1 &lt;/math&gt; to complement it in the plane. This pair of hyperbolas share the [[asymptote]]s  ''y'' = ''x''  and  ''y'' = &amp;minus;''x''. When the conjugate of the unit hyperbola is in use, the alternative radial length is &lt;math&gt;r = \sqrt {y^2 - x^2} . &lt;/math&gt;

The unit hyperbola is a special case of the [[rectangular hyperbola]], with a particular [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]], [[translation (geometry)|location]], and [[Scaling (geometry)|scale]]. As such, its [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] equals &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Weisstein]] [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RectangularHyperbola.html Rectangular hyperbola] from Wolfram Mathworld&lt;/ref&gt;

The unit hyperbola finds applications where the circle must be replaced with the hyperbola for purposes of analytic geometry. A prominent instance is the depiction of [[spacetime]] as a [[pseudo-Euclidean space]]. There the asymptotes of the unit hyperbola form a [[light cone]]. Further, the attention to areas of [[hyperbolic sector]]s by [[Gregoire de Saint-Vincent]] led to the logarithm function and the modern parametrization of the hyperbola by sector areas. When the notions of conjugate hyperbolas and hyperbolic angles are understood, then the classical [[complex number]]s, which are built around the unit circle, can be replaced with numbers built around the unit hyperbola.

==Asymptotes==
{{main|Asymptote}}
Generally asymptotic lines to a curve are said to converge toward the curve. In [[algebraic geometry]] and the theory of [[algebraic curves]] there is a different approach to asymptotes.  The curve is first interpreted in the [[projective plane]] using [[homogeneous coordinates]]. Then the asymptotes are lines that are tangent to the projective curve at a [[point at infinity]], thus circumventing any need for a distance concept and convergence.  In a common framework (''x, y, z'') are homogeneous coordinates with the [[line at infinity]] determined by the equation ''z'' = 0. For instance, C. G. Gibson wrote:&lt;ref&gt;C.G. Gibson (1998) ''Elementary Geometry of Algebraic Curves'', p 159, [[Cambridge University Press]] {{isbn|0-521-64140-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:For  the standard rectangular hyperbola &lt;math&gt;f = x^2 - y^2 -1&lt;/math&gt; in ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the corresponding projective curve is &lt;math&gt;F = x^2 - y^2 - z^2,&lt;/math&gt; which meets ''z'' = 0 at the points ''P'' = (1 : 1 : 0) and ''Q'' = (1 : &amp;minus;1 : 0). Both ''P'' and ''Q'' are [[zero (complex analysis)#Multiplicity of a zero|simple]] on ''F'', with tangents  ''x'' + ''y'' = 0, ''x'' &amp;minus; ''y'' = 0; thus we recover the familiar 'asymptotes' of elementary geometry.

==Minkowski diagram==
{{main|Minkowski diagram}}
The Minkowski diagram is drawn in a spacetime plane where the spatial aspect has been restricted to a single dimension. The units of distance and time on such a plane are 
* units of 30 centimetres length and [[nanosecond]]s, or
* [[astronomical unit]]s and intervals of 8 minutes and 20 seconds, or
* [[light year]]s and [[year]]s.
Each of these scales of coordinates results in [[photon]] connections of events along diagonal lines of [[slope]] plus or minus one.
Five elements constitute the diagram [[Hermann Minkowski]] used to describe the relativity transformations: the unit hyperbola, its conjugate hyperbola, the axes of the hyperbola, a diameter of the unit hyperbola, and the [[conjugate diameters|conjugate diameter]].
The plane with the axes refers to a resting [[frame of reference]]. The diameter of the unit hyperbola represents a frame of reference in motion with [[rapidity]] ''a'' where tanh ''a'' = ''y''/''x'' and (''x'',''y'') is the endpoint of the diameter on the unit hyperbola. The conjugate diameter represents the ''spatial hyperplane of simultaneity'' corresponding to rapidity ''a''.
In this context the unit hyperbola is a ''calibration hyperbola''&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony French]] (1968) ''Special Relativity'', page 83, [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.G.V. Rosser (1964) ''Introduction to the Theory of Relativity'', figure 6.4, page 256, London: [[Butterworths]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Commonly in relativity study the hyperbola with vertical axis is taken as primary:
:The arrow of time goes from the bottom to top of the figure — a convention adopted by [[Richard Feynman]] in his famous diagrams. Space is represented by planes perpendicular to the time axis. The here and now is a singularity in the middle.&lt;ref&gt;A.P. French (1989) "Learning from the past; Looking to the future", acceptance speech for 1989 [[Oersted Medal]], [[American Journal of Physics]] 57(7):587&amp;ndash;92&lt;/ref&gt;
The vertical time axis convention stems from Minkowski in 1908, and
is also illustrated on page 48 of Eddington's ''The Nature of the Physical World'' (1928).

==Parametrization==
{{main|Hyperbolic angle}}
[[Image:Hyperbolic functions-2.svg|thumb|296px|right|The branches of the unit hyperbola evolve as the points &lt;math&gt;(\cosh a, \sinh a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(-\cosh a, -\sinh a)&lt;/math&gt; depending on the hyperbolic angle parameter &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.]]

A direct way to parameterizing the unit hyperbola starts with the hyperbola ''xy'' = 1 parameterized with the [[exponential function]]: &lt;math&gt;( e^t, \ e^{-t}).&lt;/math&gt;

This hyperbola is transformed into the unit hyperbola by a [[linear mapping]] having the matrix &lt;math&gt;A = \tfrac {1}{2}\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; -1 \end{pmatrix}\ :&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(e^t, \ e^{-t}) \ A = (\frac{e^t + e^{-t}}{2},\ \frac{e^t - e^{-t}}{2}) = (\cosh t,\ \sinh t).&lt;/math&gt;

This parameter ''t'' is '''hyperbolic angle''', which is the [[argument of a function|argument]] of the [[hyperbolic function]]s.

One finds an early expression of the parametrized unit hyperbola in [[Elements of Dynamic]] (1878) by [[William Kingdon Clifford|W. K. Clifford]]. He describes quasi-harmonic motion in a hyperbola as follows:
:The motion &lt;math&gt;\rho = \alpha \cosh(nt + \epsilon) + \beta \sinh(nt + \epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; has some curious analogies to elliptic harmonic motion. ... The acceleration &lt;math&gt;\ddot{\rho} = n^2 \rho \ ;&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; thus it is always proportional to the distance from the centre, as in elliptic harmonic motion, but directed ''away'' from the centre.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Kingdon Clifford]] (1878) [http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=math;cc=math;view=toc;subview=short;idno=04370002 Elements of Dynamic], pages 89 &amp; 90, London: MacMillan &amp; Co; on-line presentation by [[Cornell University]] ''Historical Mathematical Monographs''&lt;/ref&gt;

As a particular [[conic section|conic]], the hyperbola can be parametrized by the process of addition of points on a conic. The following description 
was given by Russian analysts:
:Fix a point ''E'' on the conic. Consider the points at which the straight line drawn through ''E'' parallel to ''AB'' intersects the conic a second time to be the ''sum of the points A and B''.
:For the hyperbola &lt;math&gt;x^2 - y^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt; with the fixed point ''E'' = (1,0) the sum of the points &lt;math&gt;(x_1,\ y_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x_2,\ y_2)&lt;/math&gt; is the point &lt;math&gt;(x_1 x_2 + y_1 y_2,\ y_ 1 x_2 + y_2 x_1 )&lt;/math&gt; under the parametrization &lt;math&gt;x = \cosh \ t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y = \sinh \ t&lt;/math&gt; this addition corresponds to the addition of the parameter ''t''.&lt;ref&gt;Viktor Prasolov &amp; Yuri Solovyev (1997) ''Elliptic Functions and Elliptic Integrals'', page one, Translations of Mathematical Monographs volume 170, [[American Mathematical Society]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complex plane algebra==
{{main|Split-complex number}}
Whereas the unit circle is associated with [[complex number]]s, the unit hyperbola is key to the ''split-complex number plane'' consisting of ''z'' = ''x'' + ''yj'', where ''j'' &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = +1.
Then ''jz = y + xj'',  so the action of ''j'' on the plane is to swap the coordinates. In particular, this action swaps the unit hyperbola with its conjugate and swaps pairs of [[conjugate diameters]] of the hyperbolas.

In terms of the hyperbolic angle parameter ''a'', the unit hyperbola consists of points
:&lt;math&gt;\pm(\cosh a + j \sinh a) &lt;/math&gt;, where ''j'' = (0,1).
The right branch of the unit hyperbola corresponds to the positive coefficient. In fact, this branch is the image of the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] acting on the ''j''-axis. Since
:&lt;math&gt; \exp(aj) \exp(bj) = \exp((a+b)j)&lt;/math&gt;,
the branch is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under multiplication. Unlike the [[circle group]], this unit hyperbola group is ''not'' [[compact space|compact]].
Similar to the ordinary complex plane, a point not on the diagonals has a [[polar decomposition#Alternative planar decompositions|polar decomposition]] using the parametrization of the unit hyperbola and the alternative radial length.

In [[physics]], a '''Bragg plane''' is a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] in [[reciprocal space]] which bisects a reciprocal lattice vector, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt;, at right angles.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bragg plane is defined as part of the Von Laue condition for [[Interference (wave propagation)|diffraction peaks]] in [[X-ray crystallography|x-ray diffraction crystallography]].

Considering the adjacent diagram, the arriving [[x-ray]] [[plane wave]] is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;e^{i\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}} = \cos {(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r})} + i\sin {(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r})}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; is the incident wave vector given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k} = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\hat{n}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[wavelength]] of the incident [[photon]]. While the [[Bragg's law|Bragg formulation]] assumes a unique choice of direct lattice planes and [[specular reflection]] of the incident X-rays, the Von Laue formula only assumes monochromatic light and that each scattering center acts as a source of secondary wavelets as described by the [[Huygens principle]]. Each scattered wave contributes to a new plane wave given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k^\prime} = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\hat{n}^\prime&lt;/math&gt;

The condition for constructive interference in the &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \hat{n}^\prime&lt;/math&gt; direction is that the path difference between the photons is an integer multiple (m) of their wavelength. We know then that for constructive interference we have:

:&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{d}|\cos{\theta} + |\mathbf{d}|\cos{\theta^\prime} = \mathbf{d} \cdot (\hat{n} - \hat{n}^\prime) = m\lambda&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle m ~\in~ \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. Multiplying the above by &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; we formulate the condition in terms of the wave vectors, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{k^\prime}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{d} \cdot (\mathbf{k} - \mathbf{k^\prime}) = 2\pi m&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Bragg plane_illustration.png|thumb|300px|The Bragg plane in blue, with its associated reciprocal lattice vector K.]]

Now consider that a crystal is an array of scattering centres, each at a point in the [[Bravais lattice]]. We can set one of the scattering centres as the origin of an array. Since the lattice points are displaced by the Bravais lattice vectors, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;, scattered waves interfere constructively when the above condition holds simultaneously for all values of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; which are Bravais lattice vectors, the condition then becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R} \cdot \left(\mathbf{k} - \mathbf{k^\prime}\right) = 2\pi m&lt;/math&gt;

An equivalent statement (see [[Reciprocal lattice#Mathematical description|mathematical description of the reciprocal lattice]]) is to say that:

:&lt;math&gt;e^{i(\mathbf{k} - \mathbf{k^\prime}) \cdot \mathbf{R}} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

By comparing this equation with the definition of a reciprocal lattice vector, we see that constructive interference occurs if &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{K} ~=~ \mathbf{k} \,-\, \mathbf{k^\prime}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of the reciprocal lattice. We notice that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{k^\prime}&lt;/math&gt; have the same magnitude, we can restate the Von Laue formulation as requiring that the tip of incident wave vector, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt;, must lie in the plane that is a perpendicular bisector of the reciprocal lattice vector, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt;. This reciprocal space plane is the ''Bragg plane''.

In [[mathematics]], '''transversality''' is a notion that describes how spaces can intersect; transversality can be seen as the "opposite" of [[tangent|tangency]], and plays a role in [[general position]]. It formalizes the idea of a generic intersection in [[differential topology]]. It is defined by considering the linearizations of the intersecting spaces at the points of intersection.

==Definition==
[[Image:Sphere-transverse.svg|thumb|Transverse curves on the surface of a sphere]]
[[Image:Sphere-nontransverse.svg|thumb|Non-transverse curves on the surface of a sphere]]

Two [[submanifold]]s of a given finite-dimensional [[smooth manifold]] are said to '''intersect transversally''' if at every point of [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]], their separate tangent spaces at that point together generate the [[tangent space]] of the [[Ambient space|ambient manifold]] at that point.&lt;ref&gt;Guillemin and Pollack 1974, p.30.&lt;/ref&gt;  Manifolds that do not intersect are [[vacuously]] transverse. If the manifolds are of complementary dimension (i.e., their dimensions add up to the dimension of the [[ambient space]]), the condition means that the tangent space to the ambient manifold is the direct sum of the two smaller tangent spaces.  If an intersection is transverse, then the intersection will be a submanifold whose [[codimension]] is equal to the sums of the codimensions of the two manifolds. In the absence of the transversality condition the intersection may fail to be a submanifold, having some sort of [[Mathematical singularity|singular point]].

In particular, this means that transverse submanifolds of complementary dimension intersect in isolated points (i.e., a [[0-manifold]]). If both submanifolds and the ambient manifold are [[oriented]], their intersection is oriented.  When the intersection is zero-dimensional, the orientation is simply a plus or minus for each point.

One notation for the transverse intersection of two submanifolds &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt; of a given manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;L_{1} \pitchfork L_{2}&lt;/math&gt;.  This notation can be read in two ways:  either as “&lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt; intersect transversally” or as an alternative notation for the set-theoretic intersection &lt;math&gt;L_1\cap L_2&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt; when that intersection is transverse.  In this notation, the definition of transversality reads

:&lt;math&gt;L_{1} \pitchfork L_{2} \iff \forall p \in L_{1} \cap L_{2}, T_{p} M = T_{p} L_{1} + T_{p} L_{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Transversality of maps==
The notion of transversality of a pair of submanifolds is easily extended to transversality of a submanifold and a map to the ambient manifold, or to a pair of maps to the ambient manifold, by asking whether the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforwards]] of the tangent spaces along the preimage of points of intersection of the images generate the entire tangent space of the ambient manifold.&lt;ref&gt;Guillemin and Pollack 1974, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;  If the maps are [[embedding]]s, this is equivalent to transversality of submanifolds.

==Meaning of transversality for different dimensions==
[[Image:Transversality-ambient.svg|thumb|left|Transversality depends on ambient space. The two curves shown are transverse when considered as embedded in the plane, but not if we consider them as embedded in a plane in three-dimensional space]]

Suppose we have transverse maps &lt;math&gt;f_1: L_1 \to M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_2: L_2 \to M&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;L_1, L_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; are manifolds with dimensions &lt;math&gt;\ell_1, \ell_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

The meaning of transversality differs a lot depending on the relative dimensions of &lt;math&gt;M, L_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt;. The relationship between transversality and tangency is clearest when &lt;math&gt;\ell_1 + \ell_2 = m &lt;/math&gt;.

We can consider three separate cases:
#When &lt;math&gt;\ell_1 + \ell_2 &lt; m &lt;/math&gt;, it is impossible for the image of &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt;'s tangent spaces to span &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;'s tangent space at any point. Thus any intersection between &lt;math&gt;f_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_2&lt;/math&gt; cannot be transverse. However, non-intersecting manifolds vacuously satisfy the condition, so can be said to intersect transversely.
#When &lt;math&gt;\ell_1 + \ell_2 = m&lt;/math&gt;, the image of &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt;'s tangent spaces must sum directly to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;'s tangent space at any point of intersection.  Their intersection thus consists of isolated signed points, i.e. a zero-dimensional manifold.
#When &lt;math&gt;\ell_1 + \ell_2 &gt; m&lt;/math&gt; this sum needn't be direct. In fact it ''cannot'' be direct if &lt;math&gt;f_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_2&lt;/math&gt; are [[immersion (mathematics)|immersion]]s at their point of intersection, as happens in the case of embedded submanifolds.  If the maps are immersions, the intersection of their images will be a manifold of dimension &lt;math&gt;\ell_1 + \ell_2 - m.&lt;/math&gt;

==Intersection product==
Given any two smooth submanifolds, it is possible to perturb either of them by an arbitrarily small amount such that the resulting submanifold intersects transversally with the fixed submanifold. Such perturbations do not affect the [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] class of the manifolds or of their intersections. For example, if manifolds of complementary dimension intersect transversally, the signed sum of the number of their intersection points does not change even if we [[Ambient isotopy|isotope]] the manifolds to another transverse intersection.  (The intersection points can be counted modulo 2, ignoring the signs, to obtain a coarser invariant.) This descends to a bilinear intersection product on homology classes of any dimension, which is [[Poincaré dual]] to the [[cup product]] on [[cohomology]]. Like the cup product, the intersection product is [[supercommutative|graded-commutative]].

==Examples of transverse intersections==
The simplest non-trivial example of transversality is of arcs in a [[Surface (topology)|surface]]. An intersection point between two arcs is transverse [[if and only if]] it is not a tangency, i.e., their tangent lines inside the tangent plane to the surface are distinct.

In a three-dimensional space, transverse curves do not intersect. Curves transverse to surfaces intersect in points, and surfaces transverse to each other intersect in curves. Curves that are tangent to a surface at a point (for instance, curves lying on a surface) do not intersect the surface transversally.

Here is a more specialised example: suppose that &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt; is a [[simple Lie group]] and &lt;math&gt; \mathfrak{g} &lt;/math&gt; is its Lie algebra. By the [[sl2-triple|Jacobson–Morozov theorem]] every nilpotent element &lt;math&gt; e \in \mathfrak{g} &lt;/math&gt; can be included into an &lt;math&gt; \mathfrak{sl_2}&lt;/math&gt;-triple &lt;math&gt; (e, h, f) &lt;/math&gt;. The representation theory of &lt;math&gt; \mathfrak{sl_2} &lt;/math&gt; tells us that &lt;math&gt; \mathfrak{g} = [\mathfrak{g}, e] \oplus \mathfrak{g}_f &lt;/math&gt;. The space &lt;math&gt; [\mathfrak{g}, e] &lt;/math&gt; is the [[tangent space]]  at &lt;math&gt; e &lt;/math&gt; to the adjoint orbit &lt;math&gt; \rm{Ad}(G)e &lt;/math&gt; and so the [[affine space]] &lt;math&gt; e + \mathfrak{g}_f &lt;/math&gt; intersects the orbit of &lt;math&gt; e &lt;/math&gt; transversally. The space &lt;math&gt; e + \mathfrak{g}_f &lt;/math&gt; is known as the "Slodowy slice" after [[Peter Slodowy]].

==Applications==
===Optimal control===
In fields utilizing the [[calculus of variations]] or the related [[Pontryagin maximum principle]], the transversality condition is frequently used to control the types of solutions found in optimization problems.  For example, it is a necessary condition for solution curves to problems of the form:

:Minimize &lt;math&gt;\int {F(x, y, y^\prime)} dx&lt;/math&gt; where one or both of the endpoints of the curve are not fixed.
In many of these problems, the solution satisfies the condition that the solution curve should cross transversally the [[nullcline]] or some other curve describing terminal conditions.

===Smoothness of solution spaces===
Using [[Sard's theorem]], whose hypothesis is a special case of the transversality of maps, it can be shown that transverse intersections between submanifolds of a space of complementary dimensions or between submanifolds and maps to a space are themselves smooth submanifolds.  For instance, if a smooth [[Section (category theory)|section]] of an oriented manifold's [[tangent bundle]]—i.e. a [[vector field]]—is viewed as a map from the base to the total space, and intersects the zero-section (viewed either as a map or as a submanifold) transversely, then the zero set of the section—i.e. the singularities of the vector field—forms a smooth 0-dimensional submanifold of the base, i.e. a set of signed points.  The signs agree with the indices of the vector field, and thus the sum of the signs—i.e. the fundamental class of the zero set—is equal to the Euler characteristic of the manifold.  More generally, for a [[vector bundle]] over an oriented smooth closed finite-dimensional manifold, the zero set of a section transverse to the zero section will be a submanifold of the base of codimension equal to the rank of the vector bundle, and its homology class will be [[Poincaré duality|Poincaré dual]] to the [[Euler class]] of the bundle.

An extremely special case of this is the following: if a differentiable function from reals to the reals has nonzero derivative at a zero of the function, then the zero is simple, i.e. it the graph is transverse to the ''x''-axis at that zero; a zero derivative would mean a horizontal tangent to the curve, which would agree with the tangent space to the ''x''-axis.

For an infinite-dimensional example, the [[d-bar operator]] is a section of a certain [[Banach space]] bundle over the space of maps from a [[Riemann surface]] into an [[almost-complex manifold]].  The zero set of this section consists of holomorphic maps.  If the d-bar operator can be shown to be transverse to the zero-section, this [[moduli space]] will be a smooth manifold.  These considerations play a fundamental role in the theory of [[pseudoholomorphic curves]] and [[Gromov–Witten theory]]. (Note that for this example, the definition of transversality has to be refined in order to deal with [[Banach spaces]]!)

In [[mathematics]], '''geometry and topology''' is an [[umbrella term]] for the historically distinct disciplines of [[geometry]] and [[topology]], as general frameworks allow both disciplines to be manipulated uniformly, most visibly in [[Riemannian geometry#Local to global theorems|local to global theorems]] in Riemannian geometry, and results like the [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]] and [[Chern–Weil theory]].

Sharp distinctions between geometry and topology can be drawn, however, as discussed below.{{clarify|how recognized are these sharp distinctions? Are they official in the sense of professional organizations or some such, or is it up to the practitioners?|date=December 2016}}

It is also the title of a journal ''[[Geometry &amp; Topology]]'' that covers these topics.

==Scope==
It is distinct from "geometric topology", which more narrowly involves applications of topology to geometry.

It includes:
* [[Differential geometry and topology]]
* [[Geometric topology]] (including [[low-dimensional topology]] and [[surgery theory]])

It does not include such parts of [[algebraic topology]] as [[homotopy theory]], but some areas of geometry and topology (such as surgery theory, particularly [[algebraic surgery theory]]) are heavily algebraic.

==Distinction between geometry and topology==
Geometry has ''local'' structure (or infinitesimal), while topology only has ''global'' structure. Alternatively, geometry has ''continuous'' [[moduli space|moduli]], while topology has ''discrete'' moduli.

By examples, an example of geometry is [[Riemannian geometry]], while an example of topology is [[homotopy theory]]. The study of [[metric space]]s is geometry, the study of [[topological space]]s is topology.

The terms are not used completely consistently: [[symplectic manifold]]s are a boundary case, and [[Coarse structure|coarse geometry]] is global, not local.

===Local versus global structure===
By definition, [[differentiable manifold]]s of a fixed dimension are all locally diffeomorphic to [[Euclidean space]], so aside from dimension, there are no local invariants. Thus, differentiable structures on a manifold are topological in nature.

By contrast, the [[Curvature of Riemannian manifolds|curvature]] of a [[Riemannian manifold]] is a local (indeed, infinitesimal) invariant{{clarify|not clear why curvature would be invariant|date=December 2016}} (and is the only local invariant under [[isometry]]).

===Moduli===
If a structure has a discrete moduli (if it has no [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]]s, or if a deformation of a structure is isomorphic to the original structure), the structure is said to be '''rigid''', and its study (if it is a geometric or topological structure) is topology. If it has non-trivial deformations, the structure is said to be '''flexible''', and its study is geometry.

The space of [[homotopy]] classes of maps is discrete,{{efn|Given point-set conditions, which are satisfied for manifolds; more generally homotopy classes form a [[totally disconnected]] but not necessarily discrete space; for example, the [[fundamental group]] of the [[Hawaiian earring]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017|reason=Specific claim about a topological space.}}}} so studying maps up to homotopy is topology.
Similarly, differentiable structures on a manifold is usually a discrete space, and hence an example of topology, but [[exotic R4|exotic '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;s]] have continuous moduli of differentiable structures.

[[Algebraic varieties]] have continuous [[moduli space]]s, hence their study is [[algebraic geometry]]. These are finite-dimensional moduli spaces.

The space of Riemannian metrics on a given differentiable manifold is an infinite-dimensional space.

===Symplectic manifolds===
[[Symplectic manifold]]s are a boundary case, and parts of their study are called [[symplectic topology]] and [[symplectic geometry]].

By [[Darboux's theorem]], a symplectic manifold has no local structure, which suggests that their study be called topology.

By contrast, the space of symplectic structures on a manifold form a continuous moduli, which suggests that their study be called geometry.

However, up to [[Ambient isotopy|isotopy]], the space of symplectic structures is discrete (any family of symplectic structures are isotopic).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.duke.edu/~bryant/ParkCityLectures.pdf Introduction to Lie Groups and Symplectic Geometry], by [[Robert Bryant (mathematician)|Robert Bryant]], p. 103–104&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], '''transformation geometry''' (or '''transformational geometry''') is the name of a mathematical and [[pedagogic]] take on the study of [[geometry]] by focusing on [[group (mathematics)|groups]] of [[geometric transformation]]s, and properties that are [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under them.  It is opposed to the classical [[synthetic geometry]] approach of [[Euclidean geometry]], that focuses on proving [[theorem]]s.

For example, within transformation geometry, the properties of an isosceles triangle are deduced from the fact that it is mapped to itself by a [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] about a certain line. This contrasts with the classical proofs by the criteria for [[triangle congruence|congruence of triangles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/Ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=68221&amp;set=4F331370_2_173&amp;database=g Georges Glaeser – The crisis of geometry teaching]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first systematic effort to use transformations as the foundation of geometry was made by [[Felix Klein]] in the 19th century, under the name [[Erlangen programme]].  For nearly a century this approach remained confined to mathematics research circles.   In the 20th century efforts were made to exploit it for [[mathematical education]].  [[Andrei Kolmogorov]] included  this approach (together with [[set theory]]) as part of a proposal for geometry teaching reform in [[Russia]].&lt;ref name="russianedu"/&gt;  These efforts culminated in the 1960s with the general reform of mathematics teaching known as the [[New Math]] movement.

== Pedagogy ==
An exploration of transformation geometry often begins with a study of [[reflection symmetry]] as found in daily life. The first real transformation is ''[[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] in a line'' or ''reflection against an axis''. The [[function composition|composition]] of two reflections results in a [[rotation]] when the lines intersect, or a [[translation (mathematics)|translation]] when they are parallel. Thus through transformations students learn about [[Euclidean plane isometry]]. For instance, consider reflection in a vertical line and a line inclined at 45° to the horizontal. One can observe that one composition yields a counter-clockwise quarter-turn (90°) while the reverse composition yields a clockwise quarter-turn. Such results show that transformation geometry includes [[non-commutative]] processes.

An entertaining application of reflection in a line occurs in a proof of the [[one-seventh area triangle]] found in any triangle.

Another transformation introduced to young students is the [[homothetic transformation|dilation]]. However, the [[inversive geometry#reflection in a circle|reflection in a circle]] transformation seems inappropriate for lower grades. Thus [[inversive geometry]], a larger study than grade school transformation geometry, is usually reserved for college students.

Experiments with concrete [[symmetry group]]s make way for abstract [[group theory]]. Other concrete activities use computations with [[complex number]]s, [[hypercomplex number]]s, or [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] to express transformation geometry.
Such transformation geometry lessons present an alternate view that contrasts with classical [[synthetic geometry]]. When students then encounter [[analytic geometry]], the ideas of [[coordinate rotations and reflections]] follow easily. All these concepts prepare for [[linear algebra]] where the [[reflection (linear algebra)|reflection concept]] is expanded.

Educators have shown some interest and described projects and experiences with transformation geometry for children from kindergarten to high school. In the case of very young age children, in order to avoid introducing new terminology and to make links with students' everyday experience with concrete objects, it was sometimes recommended to use words they are familiar with, like "flips" for line reflections, "slides" for translations, and "turns" for rotations, although these are not precise mathematical language. In some proposals, students start by performing with concrete objects before they perform the abstract transformations via their definitions of a mapping of each point of the figure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2319962 R.S. Millman – Kleinian transformation geometry, Amer. Math. Monthly 84 (1977)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001365/136586eo.pdf UNESCO - New trends in mathematics teaching, v.3, 1972 / pg. 8]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4616&amp;context=etd Barbara Zorin – Geometric Transformations in Middle School Mathematics Textbooks]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001248/124809eo.pdf UNESCO - Studies in mathematics education. Teaching of geometry]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to restructure the courses of geometry in Russia, Kolmogorov suggested presenting it under the point of view of transformations, so the geometry courses were structured based on [[set theory]]. This led to the appearance of the term "congruent" in schools, for figures that were before called "equal": since a figure was seen as a set of points, it could only be equal to itself, and two triangles that could be overlapped by isometries were said to be [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]].&lt;ref name="russianedu"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qwyBPybT4oMC&amp;printsec=frontcover Alexander Karp &amp; Bruce R. Vogeli – Russian Mathematics Education: Programs and Practices, Volume 5], pgs. 100–102&lt;/ref&gt;

One author expressed the importance of [[group theory]] to transformation geometry as follows:
:I have gone to some trouble to develop from first principles all the group theory that I need, with the intention that my book can serve as a first introduction to transformation groups, and the notions of abstract group theory if you have never seen these.&lt;ref&gt;[[Miles Reid]] &amp; Balázs Szendröi (2005) ''Geometry and Topology'', pg. xvii, [[Cambridge University Press]], {{isbn|0-521-61325-6}}, {{MathSciNet|id=2194744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the term '''combinatorial geometry''', sometimes abbreviated to '''geometry''', was intended to replace "simple matroid".  These terms are now infrequently used in the study of matroids.

In the branch of [[mathematical logic]] called [[model theory]], infinite finitary matroids, there called "pregeometries" (and "geometries" if they are simple matroids), are used in the discussion of independence phenomena.

It turns out that many fundamental concepts of [[linear algebra]] – closure, independence, subspace, basis, dimension – are preserved in the framework of abstract geometries.

The study of how pregeometries, geometries, and abstract [[closure operator]]s influence the structure of [[first-order logic|first-order]] models is called [[geometric stability theory]].

== Definitions ==

=== Pregeometries and geometries ===
A '''combinatorial pregeometry''' (also known as a '''finitary matroid'''), is a second-order structure: &lt;math&gt;(X,\text{cl})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\text{cl}:\mathcal{P}(X)\to\mathcal{P}(X)&lt;/math&gt; (called the '''closure map''') satisfies the following axioms. For all &lt;math&gt;a, b\in X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A, B,C\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt;:

# &lt;math&gt;\text{cl}:(\mathcal{P}(X),\subseteq)\to(\mathcal{P}(X),\subseteq)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[homomorphism]] in the category of [[partial order]]s ('''monotone increasing'''), and '''dominates''' &lt;math&gt;\text{id}&lt;/math&gt; (''I.e.'' &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq B&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq\text{cl}(A)\subseteq\text{cl}(B)&lt;/math&gt;.) and is '''[[idempotent]]'''.
# '''Finite character''': For each &lt;math&gt;a\in\text{cl}(A)&lt;/math&gt; there is some finite &lt;math&gt;F\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;a\in\text{cl}(F)&lt;/math&gt;.
# '''Exchange principle''': If &lt;math&gt;b\in\text{cl}(C\cup\{a\})\smallsetminus\text{cl}(C)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a\in\text{cl}(C\cup\{b\}) &lt;/math&gt; (and hence by monotonicity and idempotence in fact &lt;math&gt;a\in\text{cl}(C\cup\{b\})\smallsetminus\text{cl}(C)&lt;/math&gt;).

A '''geometry''' is a pregeometry in which the closure of singletons are singletons and the closure of the empty set is the empty set.

=== Independence, bases and dimension ===

Given sets &lt;math&gt;A,B\subset S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is '''independent over''' &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;a\notin \text{cl}((A\setminus\{a\})\cup B)&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt;.

A set &lt;math&gt;A_0 \subset A&lt;/math&gt; is a '''basis for''' &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; '''over''' &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; if it is independent over &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A\subset \text{cl}(A_0\cup B)&lt;/math&gt;.

Since a pregeometry satisfies the Steinitz exchange property all bases are of the same cardinality, hence the definition of the '''dimension''' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\text{dim}_B A = |A_0|&lt;/math&gt; has no ambiguity.

The sets &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; are independent over &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\text{dim}_{B\cup C} = \dim_C A'&lt;/math&gt;{{Inconsistent}} whenever &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt; is a finite subset of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Note that this relation is symmetric.

In minimal sets over stable theories the independence relation coincides with the notion of forking independence.

=== Geometry automorphism ===

A '''geometry automorphism''' of a geometry &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a bijection &lt;math&gt;\sigma:2^S\to 2^S&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\sigma\text{cl}(X)=\text{cl}(\sigma X)&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;X\subset S&lt;/math&gt;.

A pregeometry &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''homogeneous''' if for any closed &lt;math&gt;X\subset S&lt;/math&gt; and any two elements &lt;math&gt;a,b\in S\setminus X&lt;/math&gt; there is an automorphism of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; which maps &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and fixes &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; pointwise.

=== The associated geometry and localizations ===

Given a pregeometry &lt;math&gt;(S,\text{cl})&lt;/math&gt; its '''associated geometry''' (sometimes referred in the literature as the '''canonical geometry''') is the geometry &lt;math&gt;(S',\text{cl}')&lt;/math&gt; where

#&lt;math&gt;S'=\{\text{cl}(a)\mid a\in S\setminus \text{cl} (\emptyset)\}&lt;/math&gt;, and
#For any &lt;math&gt;X\subset S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\text{cl}'(\{\text{cl}(a)\mid a\in X\}) = \{\text{cl}(b)\mid b\in\text{cl}(X)\}&lt;/math&gt;

Its easy to see that the associated geometry of a homogeneous pregeometry is homogeneous.

Given &lt;math&gt;A\subset S&lt;/math&gt; the '''localization''' of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the geometry &lt;math&gt;(S,\text{cl}_A)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\text{cl}_A(X)=\text{cl}(X\cup A)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Types of pregeometries ===

Let &lt;math&gt;(S,\text{cl})&lt;/math&gt; be a pregeometry, then it is said to be:

* '''trivial''' (or '''degenerate''') if &lt;math&gt;\text{cl}(X)=\bigcup\{\text{cl}(a)\mid a\in X\}&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''modular''' if any two closed finite dimensional sets &lt;math&gt;X,Y\subset S&lt;/math&gt; satisfy the equation &lt;math&gt;
\text{dim}(X\cup Y) = \text{dim}(X) + \text{dim}(Y) - \text{dim}(X\cap Y)
&lt;/math&gt; (or equivalently that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is independent of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;X\cap Y&lt;/math&gt;).
* '''locally modular''' if it has a localization at a singleton which is modular.
* (locally) '''projective''' if it is non-trivial and (locally) modular.
* '''locally finite''' if closures of finite sets are finite.

Triviality, modularity and local modularity pass to the associated geometry and are preserved under localization.

If &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a locally modular homogeneous pregeometry and &lt;math&gt;a\in S\setminus\text{cl}\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; then the localization of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is modular.

The geometry &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is modular if and only if whenever &lt;math&gt;a,b\in S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A\subset S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\text{dim}\{a,b\}=2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\text{dim}_A\{a,b\} \le 1&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;(\text{cl}\{a,b\}\cap\text{cl}(A))\setminus\text{cl}\emptyset\ne\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.

== Examples ==

=== The trivial example ===

If &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is any set we may define &lt;math&gt;\text{cl}(A)=A&lt;/math&gt;. This pregeometry is a trivial, homogeneous, locally finite geometry.

=== Vector spaces and projective spaces ===

Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be a field (a division ring actually suffices) and let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be a &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional vector space over &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a pregeometry where closures of sets are defined to be their span.

This pregeometry is homogeneous and modular. Vector spaces are considered to be the prototypical example of modularity.

&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is locally finite if and only if &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is finite.

&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is not a geometry, as the closure of any nontrivial vector is a subspace of size at least &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;.

The associated geometry of a &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional vector space over &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;(\kappa-1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[projective space]] over &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. It is easy to see that this pregeometry is a projective geometry.

=== Affine spaces ===

Let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be a &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[affine space]] over a field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. Given a set define its closure to be its [[affine hull]] (i.e. the smallest affine subspace containing it).

This forms a homogeneous &lt;math&gt;(\kappa+1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional geometry.

An affine space is not modular (for example, if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; be parallel lines then the formula in the definition of modularity fails). However, it is easy to check that all localizations are modular.

=== Algebraically closed fields ===

Let &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; be an algebraically closed field with &lt;math&gt;\text{tr.deg}(k)\ge\omega&lt;/math&gt;, and define the closure of a set to be its algebraic closure.

While vector spaces are modular and affine spaces are "almost" modular (i.e. everywhere locally modular), algebraically closed fields are examples of the other extremity, not being even locally modular (i.e. none of the localizations is modular).

Common problems in this field relate to

* ''Reconstruction'' of geometric structures (for example, points or lines) in the 3D world based on measurements in 2D images

The geometric structures studied in this field does not have to be restricted to points or lines in two or three dimensions but can also be related to entire objects, for example the [[pose (computer vision)|pose]] of such an object.

In [[physics]], a '''pregeometry''' is a structure from which the [[geometry]] of the [[universe]] develops. Some [[cosmological model]]s feature a pregeometric universe before the Big Bang. The term was championed by [[John Archibald Wheeler]] in the 1960s and 1970s as a possible route to a theory of [[quantum gravity]]. Since [[quantum mechanics]] allowed a metric to fluctuate, it was argued that the merging of gravity with quantum mechanics required a set of more fundamental rules regarding [[Connection (mathematics)|connectivity]] that were independent of [[topology]] and [[dimensionality]]. Where geometry could describe the properties of a known surface, the physics of a hypothetical region with predefined properties, "pregeometry" might allow one to work with deeper underlying rules of physics that were not so strongly dependent on simplified classical assumptions about the properties of space.

No single proposal for pregeometry has gained wide consensus support in the physics community. Some notions related to pregeometry predate Wheeler, other notions depart considerably from his outline of pregeometry but are still associated with it. A 2006 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meschini|title=Geometry, pregeometry and beyond|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics|date=August 2006|arxiv=gr-qc/0411053|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2005.01.002|volume=36|issue=3|pages=435–464|bibcode=2005SHPMP..36..435M}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided a survey and critique of pregeometry or near-pregeometry proposals up to that time. A summary of these is given below:

;Discrete spacetime by Hill: A proposal anticipating Wheeler's pregeometry, though assuming some geometric notions embedded in quantum mechanics and [[special relativity]]. A subgroup of [[Lorentz transformations]] with only [[Rational number|rational]] coefficients is deployed. Energy and [[momentum]] variables are restricted to a certain set of rational numbers. Quantum [[wave function]]s work out to be a special case semi-periodical functions though the nature of [[wave function]]s is ambiguous since the energy-momentum space cannot be uniquely interpreted.

;Discrete-space structure by Dadic and Pisk: Spacetime as an [[Graph labeling|unlabeled graph]] whose topological structure entirely characterizes the graph. Spatial points are related to [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]]. Operators define the creation or annihilation of lines which develop into a [[Fock space]] framework. This discrete-space structure assumes the metric of spacetime and assumes composite geometric objects so it is not a pregeometric scheme in line with Wheeler's original conception of pregeometry.

;Pregeometric graph by Wilson: Spacetime is described by a generalized graph consisting of a very large or infinite set of vertices paired with a very large or infinite set of edges. From that graph emerge various constructions such as vertices with multiple edges, loops, and directed edges. These in turn support formulations of the [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metrical]] foundation of space-time.

;Number theory pregeometry by Volovich: Spacetime as a [[Archimedean property|non-Archimedean]] geometry over a field of rational numbers and a finite [[Finite field|Galois field]] where rational numbers themselves undergo quantum fluctuations.

;Causal sets by Bombelli, Lee, Meyer and Sorkin: All of spacetime at very small scales is a [[Causal sets|causal set]] consisting of locally [[finite set]] of elements with a [[partial order]] linked to the notion of past and future in macroscopic spacetime and causality between point-events. Derived from the causal order is the differential structure and the conformal metric of a manifold. A probability is assigned to a [[Causal sets|causal set]] becoming embedded in a manifold; thus there can be a transition from a discrete Planck scale fundamental unit of volume to a classical large scale continuous space.

;Random graphs by Antonsen: Spacetime is described by [[Graph dynamical system|dynamical graphs]] with points (associated with vertices) and links (of unit length) that are created or annihilated according to probability calculations. The parameterization of graphs in a metaspace gives rise to time.

;Bootstrap universe by Cahill and Klinger: An iterative map composed of [[monad (philosophy)|monad]]s and the relations between them becomes a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree-graph]] of nodes and links. A definition of distance between any two monads is defined and from this and probabilistic mathematical tools emerges a three-dimensional space.

;Axiomatic pregeometry by Perez, Bergliaffa, Romero and Vucetich: An assortment of ontological presuppositions describes spacetime a result of relations between objectively existing entities. From presuppositions emerges the topology and metric of [[Minkowski space]]time.

;Cellular networks by Requardt: Space is described by a graph with densely entangled sub-clusters of nodes (with differential states) and bonds (either vanishing at 0 or directed at 1). Rules describe the evolution of the graph from a chaotic patternless pre-Big Bang condition to a stable spacetime in the present. Time emerges from a deeper external-parameter "clock-time" and the graphs lead to a natural metrical structure.

;Simplicial quantum gravity by Lehto, Nielsen and Ninomiya: Spacetime is described as having a deeper pregeometric structure based on three dynamical variables, vertices of an [[abstract simplicial complex]], and a real-valued field associated with every pair of vertices; the abstract simplicial complex is set to correspond with a geometric simplicial complex and then geometric simplices are stitched together into a piecewise linear space. Developed further, triangulation, link distance, a piecewise linear manifold, and a spacetime metric arise. Further, a [[Lattice model (physics)|lattice]] quantization is formulated resulting in a quantum gravity description of spacetime.

;Quantum automaton universe by Jaroszkiewicz and Eakins: Event states (elementary or entangled) are provided topological relationships via tests ([[Hermitian adjoint|Hermitian operators]]) endowing the event states with evolution, irreversible acquisition of information, and a [[Arrow of time#The quantum arrow of time|quantum arrow of time]]. Information content in various ages of the universe modifies the tests so the universe acts as an automaton, modifying its structure. Causal set theory is then worked out within this quantum automaton framework to describe a spacetime that inherits the assumptions of geometry within standard quantum mechanics.

;Rational-number spacetime by Horzela, Kapuscik, Kempczynski and Uzes: A preliminary investigation into how all events might be mapped with rational number coordinates and how this might help to better understand a discrete spacetime framework.

In [[geometry]], an '''affine plane''' is a system of points and lines that satisfy the following axioms:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|Piper|1973|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Any two distinct points lie on a unique line.
* Each line has at least two points.
* Given any line and any point not on that line there is a unique line which contains the point and does not meet the given line. ([[Playfair's axiom]])
* There exist three non-collinear points (points not on a single line).

In an affine plane, two lines are called ''parallel'' if they are equal or [[disjoint sets|disjoint]]. Using this definition, Playfair's axiom above can be replaced by:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hartshorne|2000|page= 71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Given a point and a line, there is a unique line which contains the point and is parallel to the line.

Parallelism is an [[equivalence relation]] on the lines of an affine plane.

Since no concepts other than those involving the relationship between points and lines are involved in the axioms, an affine plane is an object of study belonging to [[incidence geometry]]. They are non-degenerate [[Linear space (geometry)|linear spaces]] satisfying Playfair's axiom.

The familiar [[Euclidean plane]] is an affine plane. There are many finite and infinite affine planes. As well as [[affine plane]]s over fields (and [[division ring]]s), there are also many [[non-Desarguesian plane]]s, not derived from coordinates in a division ring, satisfying these axioms. The [[Moulton plane]] is an example of one of these.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Moulton | first1=Forest Ray | title=A Simple Non-Desarguesian Plane Geometry | jstor=1986419 | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | location=Providence, R.I. | year=1902 | journal=[[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]] | issn=0002-9947 | volume=3 | issue=2 | pages=192–195 | doi=10.2307/1986419| doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finite affine planes==
[[File:Hesse configuration.svg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Affine plane of order 3 &lt;br&gt; 9 points, 12 lines&lt;/center&gt;]]

If the number of points in an affine plane is finite, then if one line of the plane contains {{math|''n''}} points then:
* each line contains {{math|''n''}} points,
* each point is contained in {{math|''n'' + 1}} lines,
* there are {{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} points in all, and
* there is a total of {{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''n''}} lines.
The number {{math|''n''}} is called the ''order'' of the affine plane.

All known finite affine planes have orders that are prime or prime power integers. The smallest affine plane (of order 2) is obtained by removing a line and the three points on that line from the [[Fano plane]]. A similar construction, starting from the projective plane of order three, produces the affine plane of order three sometimes called the [[Hesse configuration]]. An affine plane of order {{math|''n''}} exists if and only if a [[projective plane#Finite projective planes|projective plane]] of order {{math|''n''}} exists (however, the definition of order in these two cases is not the same). Thus, there is no affine plane of order 6 or order 10 since there are no projective planes of those orders. The [[Bruck–Ryser–Chowla theorem]] provides further limitations on the order of a projective plane, and thus, the order of an affine plane.

The {{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''n''}} lines of an affine plane of order {{math|''n''}} fall into {{math|''n'' + 1}} equivalence classes of {{math|''n''}} lines apiece under the equivalence relation of parallelism. These classes are called ''parallel classes'' of lines. The lines in any parallel class form a partition the points of the affine plane. Each of the {{math|''n'' + 1}} lines that pass through a single point lies in a different parallel class.

The parallel class structure of an affine plane of order {{math|''n''}} may be used to construct a set of {{math|''n'' − 1}} [[mutually orthogonal latin square]]s. Only the incidence relations are needed for this construction.

==Relation with projective planes==
{{main|Projective plane}}

An affine plane can be obtained from any [[projective plane]] by removing a line and all the points on it, and conversely any affine plane can be used to construct a projective plane by adding a [[line at infinity]], each of whose points is that [[point at infinity]] where an equivalence class of parallel lines meets.

If the projective plane is [[Non-Desarguesian plane|non-Desarguesian]], the removal of different lines could result in non-isomorphic affine planes. For instance, there are exactly four projective planes of order nine, and seven affine planes of order nine.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moorhouse|2007|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is only one affine plane corresponding to the [[Desarguesian plane]] of order nine since the [[Collineation|collineation group]] of that projective plane acts [[Transitive (group action)|transitively]] on the lines of the plane. Each of the three non-Desarguesian planes of order nine have collineation groups having two orbits on the lines, producing two non-isomorphic affine planes of order nine, depending on which orbit the line to be removed is selected from.

==Affine translation planes==

A line {{math|''l''}} in a projective plane {{math|Π}} is a '''translation line''' if the group of elations with axis {{math|''l''}} [[Group action (mathematics)|acts]] [[Transitive property|transitively]] on the points of the affine plane obtained by removing {{math|''l''}} from the plane {{math|Π}}. A projective plane with a translation line is called a '''translation plane''' and the affine plane obtained by removing the translation line is called an '''affine translation plane'''. While in general it is often easier to work with projective planes, in this context the affine planes are preferred and several authors simply use the term translation plane to mean affine translation plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|Piper|1973|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternate view of affine translation planes can be obtained as follows: Let {{math|''V''}} be a {{math|2''n''}}-dimensional [[vector space]] over a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] {{math|''F''}}. A '''spread''' of {{math|''V''}} is a set {{math|''S''}} of {{math|''n''}}-dimensional subspaces of {{math|''V''}} that partition the non-zero vectors of {{math|''V''}}. The members of {{math|''S''}} are called the '''components''' of the spread and if {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are distinct components then {{math|1=''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊕ ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''V''}}. Let {{math|''A''}} be the [[incidence structure]] whose points are the vectors of {{math|''V''}} and whose lines are the cosets of components, that is, sets of the form {{math|''v'' + ''U''}} where {{math|''v''}} is a vector of {{math|''V''}} and {{math|''U''}} is a component of the spread {{math|''S''}}. Then:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moorhouse|2007|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{math|''A''}} is an affine plane and the group of [[Translation (geometry)|translations]] {{math|''x'' → ''x'' + ''w''}} for a vector {{math|''w''}} is an automorphism group acting regularly on the points of this plane.

==Generalization: {{math|''k''}}-nets==

An incidence structure more general than a finite affine plane is a {{math|''k''}}-''net of order'' {{math|''n''}}. This consists of {{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} points and {{math|''nk''}} lines such that:
* Parallelism (as defined in affine planes) is an equivalence relation on the set of lines.
* Every line has exactly {{math|''n''}} points, and every parallel class has {{math|''n''}} lines (so each parallel class of lines partitions the point set).
* There are {{math|''k''}} parallel classes of lines. Each point lies on exactly {{math|''k''}} lines, one from each parallel class.

An {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-net of order {{math|''n''}} is precisely an affine plane of order {{math|''n''}}.

A {{math|''k''}}-''net of order'' {{math|''n''}} is equivalent  to a set of {{math|''k'' − 2}} mutually orthogonal Latin squares of order {{math|''n''}}.

===Example: translation nets===

For an arbitrary field {{math|''F''}}, let {{math|Σ}} be a set of {{math|''n''}}-dimensional subspaces of the vector space {{math|''F''&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, any two of which intersect only in {0} (called a '''partial spread'''). The members of {{math|Σ}}, and their cosets in {{math|''F''&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, form the lines of a '''translation net''' on the points of {{math|''F''&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. If {{math|1={{abs|Σ}} = ''k''}} this is a {{math|''k''}}-net of order {{math|{{abs|''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}. Starting with an affine [[translation plane]], any subset of the parallel classes will form a translation net.

Given a translation net, it is not always possible to add parallel classes to the net to form an affine plane. However, if {{math|''F''}} is an infinite field, any partial spread {{math|Σ}} with fewer than {{math|{{abs|''F''}}}} members can be extended and the translation net can be completed to an affine translation plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moorhouse|2007|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geometric codes==
Given the "line/point" [[incidence matrix]] of any finite [[incidence structure]], {{math|''M''}}, and any [[Field (mathematics)|field]], {{math|''F''}} the row space of {{math|''M''}} over {{math|''F''}} is a [[linear code]] that we can denote by {{math|1=''C'' = ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'')}}. Another related code that contains information about the incidence structure is the '''Hull''' of {{math|''C''}} which is defined as:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Assmus Jr.|Key|1992|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hull}(C) = C \cap C^{\perp},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the orthogonal code to {{math|''C''}}.

Not much can be said about these codes at this level of generality, but if the incidence structure has some "regularity" the codes produced this way can be analyzed and information about the codes and the incidence structures can be gleaned from each other. When the incidence structure is a finite affine plane, the codes belong to a class of codes known as ''geometric codes''. How much information the code carries about the affine plane depends in part on the choice of field. If the [[Characteristic (field)|characteristic]] of the field does not divide the order of the plane, the code generated is the full space and does not carry any information. On the other hand,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Assmus Jr.|Key|1992|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* If {{math|''π''}} is an affine plane of order {{math|''n''}} and {{math|''F''}} is a field of characteristic {{math|''p''}}, where {{math|''p''}} divides {{math|''n''}}, then the minimum weight of the code {{math|1=''B'' = Hull(''C''&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt;(''π''))&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;}} is {{math|''n''}} and all the minimum weight vectors are constant multiples of vectors whose entries are either zero or one.

Furthermore,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Assmus Jr.|Key|1992|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* If {{math|''π''}} is an affine plane of order {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''F''}} is a field of characteristic {{math|''p''}}, then {{math|1=''C'' = Hull(''C''&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt;(''π''))&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;}} and the minimum weight vectors are precisely the scalar multiples of the (incidence vectors of) lines of  {{math|''π''}}.

When {{math|1=''π'' = AG(2, ''q'')}} the geometric code generated is the {{math|''q''}}-ary [[Reed-Muller Code]].

==Affine spaces==
[[Affine space]]s can be defined in an analogous manner to the construction of affine planes from projective planes. It is also possible to provide a system of axioms for the higher-dimensional affine spaces which does not refer to the corresponding [[projective space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lenz|1961|page= 138}}, but see also {{harvnb|Cameron|1991|loc=chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], '''Lill's method''' is a visual method of finding the [[real number|real]] [[zero of a function|roots]] of [[polynomial]]s of any [[degree of a polynomial|degree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Uncommon Mathematical Excursions: Polynomia and Related Realms |url=https://archive.org/details/uncommonmathemat00kalm_338 |url-access=limited |author=Dan Kalman |publisher=AMS |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-88385-341-2 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/uncommonmathemat00kalm_338/page/n29 13]–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was developed by Austrian engineer [[Eduard Lill]] in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Résolution graphique des équations numériques de tous degrés à une seule inconnue, et description d'un instrument inventé dans ce but |author= M. E. Lill |journal=[[Nouvelles Annales de Mathématiques]] |series=2 |volume=6 |year=1867 |pages=359–362}} ([https://eudml.org/doc/98167 online copy])&lt;/ref&gt;  A later paper by Lill dealt with the problem of [[complex numbers|complex]] roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Résolution graphique des équations algébriques qui ont des racines imaginaires |author= M. E. Lill|journal=[[Nouvelles Annales de Mathématiques]] |series=2 |volume=7 |year=1868 |pages=363–367}} ([https://eudml.org/doc/98262 online copy])&lt;/ref&gt;

Lill's method involves expressing the coefficients of a polynomial as magnitudes of segments at right angles to each other, starting from the origin, creating a path to a terminus, then finding a non-right angle path from the start to the terminus reflecting or refracting on the lines of the first path.

==Description of the method==
[[File:LillsMethod.svg|thumb|right|250px|Finding roots of the cubic 4''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+2''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;−2''x''−1 using Lill's method. Roots are −1/2, −1/{{radic|2}}, 1/{{radic|2}}. Numbers on black segments are distances (coefficients in the equation), while a number shown on a colored line is the negative of the slope and hence a real root of the polynomial. ]]

To employ the method a diagram is drawn starting at the origin. A line segment is drawn rightwards by the magnitude of the first coefficient (the coefficient of the highest-power term)  (so that with a negative coefficient the segment will end left of the origin). From the end of the first segment another segment is drawn upwards by the magnitude of the second coefficient, then left by the magnitude of the third, and down by the magnitude of the fourth, and so on.  The sequence of directions (not turns) is always rightward, upward, leftward, downward, then repeating itself. Thus each turn is counterclockwise. The process continues for every coefficient of the polynomial including zeroes, with negative coefficients "walking backwards". The final point reached, at the end of the segment corresponding to the equation's constant term, is the terminus.

A line is then launched from the origin at some angle {{mvar|θ}}, reflected off of each line segment at a right angle (not necessarily the "natural" angle of reflection), and [[Refraction|refracted]] at a right angle through the line through each segment (including a line for the zero coefficients) when the angled path does not hit the line segment on that line.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips Verner Bradford, Sc.D.. ''[http://www.concentric.net/~pvb/ALG/rightpaths.html Visualizing solutions to n-th degree algebraic equations using right-angle geometric paths.]''  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502013959/http://www.concentric.net/~pvb/ALG/rightpaths.html |date=May 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vertical and horizontal lines are reflected off or refracted through in the following sequence: the line containing the segment corresponding to the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x^{n-1},&lt;/math&gt; then of &lt;math&gt;x^{n-2},&lt;/math&gt; etc. Choosing {{mvar|θ}} so that the path lands on the terminus, the negative of the tangent of {{mvar|θ}} is a root of this polynomial. For every real zero of the polynomial there will be one unique initial angle and path that will land on the terminus. A quadratic with two real roots, for example, will have exactly two angles that satisfy the above conditions.

The construction in effect evaluates the polynomial according to [[Horner's method]]. For the polynomial &lt;math&gt;a_n x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+a_{n-2}x^{n-2}+ \cdots&lt;/math&gt; the values of &lt;math&gt;a_n x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(a_n x+a_{n-1})x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;((a_n x+a_{n-1})x+a_{n-2})x,\ \dots&lt;/math&gt; are successively generated. A solution line giving a root is similar to the Lill's construction for the polynomial with that root removed.

In 1936 [[Margherita Piazzola Beloch]] showed how Lill's method could be adapted to solve cubic equations using [[paper folding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Solving Cubics With Creases: The Work of Beloch and Lill |author=Thomas C.

'''Lacunarity''', from the Latin [[wikt:lacuna|lacuna]], meaning "gap" or "lake", is a specialized term in [[geometry]] referring to a measure of how patterns, especially [[fractal]]s, fill space, where patterns having more or larger gaps generally have higher lacunarity. Beyond being an intuitive measure of gappiness, lacunarity can quantify additional features of patterns such as "rotational invariance" and more generally, heterogeneity.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{Cite journal

== Measuring lacunarity ==
In many patterns or data sets, lacunarity is not readily perceivable or quantifiable, so computer-aided methods have been developed to calculate it. As a measurable quantity, lacunarity is often denoted in scientific literature by the Greek letters &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; but it is important to note that there is no single standard and several different methods exist to assess and interpret lacunarity.

=== Box counting lacunarity ===
[[File:Fixedstack.gif|thumb|right|400px|Figure 2a. Boxes laid over an image as a fixed grid.
[[File:Slidestack.gif|thumb|right|400px|Figure 2b. Boxes slid over an image in an overlapping pattern.]]]]
One well-known method of determining lacunarity for patterns extracted from digital images uses [[box counting]], the same essential algorithm typically used for some types of [[fractal analysis]].&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mandelbrot"/&gt; Similar to looking at a slide through a microscope with changing levels of magnification, box counting algorithms look at a digital image from many levels of resolution to examine how certain features change with the size of the element used to inspect the image. Basically, the arrangement of pixels is measured using traditionally square (i.e., box-shaped) elements from an arbitrary set of &lt;math&gt;\Epsilon&lt;/math&gt; sizes, conventionally denoted &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;s.  For each &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, the box is placed successively over the entire image, and each time it is laid down, the number of pixels that fall within the box is recorded.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This contrasts with [[box counting]] fractal analysis where the ''total number of boxes that contained any pixels'' is counted to determine a fractal dimension.&lt;/ref&gt; In '''standard box counting''', the box for each &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is placed as though it were part of a grid overlaid on the image so that the box does not overlap itself, but in '''sliding box algorithms''' the box is slid over the image so that it overlaps itself and the "Sliding Box Lacunarity" or SLac is calculated.&lt;ref name="plotnick"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wiens"/&gt; Figure 2 illustrates both types of box counting.

==== Calculations from box counting ====
The data gathered for each &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; are manipulated to calculate lacunarity. One measure, denoted here as &lt;math&gt;\lambda_\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, is found from the coefficient of variation (&lt;math&gt;\mathit{CV}&lt;/math&gt;), calculated as the standard deviation (&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;) divided by the mean (&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;), for pixels per box.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="plotnick"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid-18595800/&gt; Because the way an image is sampled will depend on the arbitrary starting location, for any image sampled at any &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; there will be some number (&lt;math&gt;\mathit{G}&lt;/math&gt;) of possible orientations, each denoted here by &lt;math&gt;\mathit{g}&lt;/math&gt;, that the data can be gathered over, which can have varying effects on the measured distribution of pixels.&lt;ref name="Karperien"&gt;{{cite book|title=Defining Microglial Morphology: Form, Function, and Fractal Dimension|author=Karperien|year=2004|publisher=Charles Sturt University |chapter=Chapter 8 Multifractality and Lacunarity|chapter-url=http://bilby.unilinc.edu.au/R/-?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;amp;object_id=31797&amp;amp;silo_library=GEN01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See {{harvnb|FracLac|loc=[http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/fraclac/FLHelp/BoxCounting.htm#gridlocation Box Counting]}} for an explanation of methods to address variation with grid location&lt;/ref&gt; Equation {{EquationNote|1}} shows the basic method of calculating &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{\varepsilon,g}&lt;/math&gt;:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\lambda_{\varepsilon,g} = (CV_{\varepsilon,g})^2 = \left( \frac  {\sigma_{\varepsilon,g}}   {\mu_{\varepsilon,g}}  \right)^2 &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

===== Probability distributions =====
Alternatively, some methods sort the numbers of pixels counted into a probability distribution having &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; bins, and use the bin sizes (masses, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;) and their corresponding probabilities (&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;) to calculate &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{\varepsilon,g}&lt;/math&gt; according to Equations {{EquationNote|2}} through {{EquationNote|5}}: 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mu_{\varepsilon}=\sum_{i=1}^{B} {m_{i,\varepsilon} p_{i,\varepsilon}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mathit{v}_{\varepsilon}=\sum_{i-1}^{B} {\left( m_{i,\varepsilon} - \mu_{\varepsilon} \right ) ^2 p_{i,\varepsilon}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{\varepsilon}=\sqrt{\mathit{v}_{\varepsilon}}=\sum_{i=1}^{B} {m_{i,\varepsilon}^2 p_{i,\varepsilon}-\mu_{\varepsilon}^2}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\lambda_{\varepsilon}= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{B} {m_{i,\varepsilon}^2 p_{i,\varepsilon}-\mu_{\varepsilon}^2}}{\mu_{\varepsilon}^2} = \frac{\sigma_{\varepsilon}^2}{\mu_{\varepsilon}^2}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

==== Interpreting ''&amp;lambda;'' ====
Lacunarity based on &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{\varepsilon,g}&lt;/math&gt; has been assessed in several ways including by using the variation in or the average value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{\varepsilon,g}&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; (see Equation {{EquationNote|6}}) and by using the variation in or average over all grids (see Equation {{EquationNote|7}}).&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Karperien"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wiens"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McIntyre | first1 = N. E. | last2 = Wiens | first2 = J. A. | journal = Landscape Ecology | volume = 15 |title=A novel use of the lacunarity index to discern landscape function| issue = 4 | pages = 313 | year = 2000 | doi = 10.1023/A:1008148514268 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jelinek"/&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\overline{\lambda_{\varepsilon,g}}=\frac{\sum_{\varepsilon=1}^\Epsilon \lambda_{\varepsilon,g}}{\Epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Lambda_{\mathit{g}}=\frac{\sum_{\mathit{g}=1}^\mathit{G} \overline{\lambda_{\varepsilon,g}}}{\mathit{G}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}

===== Relationship to the fractal dimension =====
Lacunarity analyses using the types of values discussed above have shown that data sets extracted from dense fractals, from patterns that change little when rotated, or from patterns that are homogeneous, have low lacunarity, but as these features increase,{{clarify|What increases lacunarity, repetition of low-lac. pattern, or another feature?|date=October 2012}} so generally does lacunarity. In some instances, it has been demonstrated that fractal dimensions and values of lacunarity were correlated,&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt; but more recent research has shown that this relationship does not hold for all types of patterns and measures of lacunarity.&lt;ref name="Karperien"/&gt; Indeed, as Mandelbrot originally proposed, lacunarity has been shown to be useful in discerning amongst patterns (e.g., fractals, textures, etc.) that share or have similar [[fractal dimension]]s in a variety of scientific fields including neuroscience.&lt;ref name="Jelinek"&gt;{{cite book|title=8th European Conference on Mathematical and Theoretical Biology, Kraków |first1=Herbert |last1=Jelinek |first2=Audrey |last2=Karperien |first3=Nebojsa |last3=Milosevic |chapter= Lacunarity Analysis and Classification of Microglia in Neuroscience|date=June 2011|chapter-url=http://www.impan.pl/~ecmtb11/showabstract.php?id=Jelinek_Herbert1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Graphical lacunarity ====
Other methods of assessing lacunarity from box counting data use the relationship between values of lacunarity (e.g., &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{\varepsilon,g}&lt;/math&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; in different ways from the ones noted above. One such method looks at the &lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt; vs &lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt; plot of these values. According to this method, the curve itself can be analyzed visually, or the slope at &lt;math&gt;\mathit{g}&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated from the &lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt; vs &lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt; regression line.&lt;ref name="plotnick"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wiens"/&gt; Because they tend to behave in certain ways for respectively mono-, multi-, and non-fractal patterns, &lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt; vs &lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt; lacunarity plots have been used to supplement methods of classifying such patterns.&lt;ref name="Karperien"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jelinek"/&gt;

To make the plots for this type of analysis, the data from box counting first have to be transformed as in Equation {{EquationNote|9}}:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;f \lambda_{\varepsilon,g}=\lambda_{\varepsilon,g}+1&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|9}}}}
This transformation avoids undefined values, which is important because homogeneous images will have &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; at some &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; equal to 0 so that the slope of the &lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt; vs &lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt; regression line would be impossible to find. With &lt;math&gt;f \lambda_{\varepsilon,g}&lt;/math&gt;, homogeneous images have a slope of 0, corresponding intuitively to the idea of no rotational or translational invariance and no gaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Karperien|title=Interpreting Lacunarity |year=2002 |work=FracLac |url=http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/fraclac/FLHelp/lactutorial.htm#oneplus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One box counting technique using a "gliding" box calculates lacunarity according to: 
{{NumBlk|:| &lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{L}(r) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{r^2} S_i^2 Q(S_i,r)}{ \left( \sum_{i=1}^{r^2}  S_i Q(S_i,r) \right)^2 }.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|10}}}}
&lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; is the number of filled data points in the box and &lt;math&gt;Q(S_i,r)&lt;/math&gt; the normalized frequency distribution of &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; for different box sizes.

==== Prefactor lacunarity ====
Another proposed way of assessing lacunarity using box counting, the ''Prefactor'' method, is based on the value obtained from box counting for the fractal dimension (&lt;math&gt;D_B&lt;/math&gt;). This statistic uses the variable &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; from the scaling rule &lt;math&gt;N = A \varepsilon^{D_B}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is calculated from the y-intercept (&lt;math&gt;\mathit{y}&lt;/math&gt;) of the ln-ln regression line for &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; and either the count (&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;) of boxes that had any pixels at all in them or else &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is particularly affected by image size and the way data are gathered, especially by the lower limit of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;s used. The final measure is calculated as shown in Equations {{EquationNote|11}} through {{EquationNote|13}}:&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mandelbrot"/&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;A_g = \frac{1}{e^{\mathit{y}_g}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|11}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\overline{A} = \frac{\sum_{g=1}^G A_g}{G} &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|12}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;P \Lambda = \frac {  \sum_{g=1}^G { \left ( {\frac{A_g}{\overline A}}-1   \right ) ^2}}{G} &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|13}}}}

      <text bytes="4064" xml:space="preserve">In [[geometry]], the '''exsphere''' of a face of a regular polyhedron is the sphere outside the polyhedron which touches the face and the planes defined by extending the adjacent faces outwards. It is tangent to the face externally and tangent to the adjacent faces internally.

It is the 3-dimensional equivalent of the [[excircle]].

The sphere is more generally well-defined for any face which is a regular
polygon and delimited by faces with the same dihedral angles
at the shared edges. Faces of semi-regular polyhedra often 
have different types of faces, which define exspheres of different size with each type of face.

== Parameters ==
The exsphere touches the face of the regular polyedron at the center
of the incircle of that face. If the exsphere radius is denoted {{math|r&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the radius of this incircle {{math|r&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;}}
and the dihedral angle between the face and the extension of the 
adjacent face {{math|&amp;delta;}}, the center of the exsphere
is located from the viewpoint at the middle of one edge of the
face by bisecting the dihedral angle. Therefore

:&lt;math&gt;\tan\frac{\delta}{2} = \frac{r_{\mathrm{ex}}}{r_{\mathrm{in}}}.&lt;/math&gt;

{{math|&amp;delta;}} is the 180-degree complement of the 
internal face-to-face angle.

=== Tetrahedron ===
Applied to the geometry of the [[Tetrahedron]] of edge length {{math|a}},
we have an [[Incircle|incircle radius]] {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''a''/(2{{radic|3}})}} (derived by dividing twice the face area {{math|(''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;{{radic|3}})/4}} through the
perimeter {{math|3''a''}}), a dihedral angle {{math|''&amp;delta;'' {{=}} ''&amp;pi;'' - arccos(1/3)}}, and in consequence {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''a''/{{radic|6}}}}.

=== Cube ===
The radius of the exspheres of the 6 faces of the [[Cube]]
is the same as the radius of the inscribed
sphere, since {{math|&amp;delta;}} and its complement are the same, 90 degrees.

=== Icosahedron ===
The dihedral angle applicable to the [[Icosahedron]] is derived by
considering the coordinates of two triangles with a common edge,
for [[Icosahedron#Cartesian coordinates|example]] one face with vertices
at

:&lt;math&gt;(0,-1,g), (g,0,1), (0,1,g),&lt;/math&gt;

the other at

:&lt;math&gt;(1,-g,0), (g,0,1), (0,-1,g),&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|g}} is the [[golden ratio]]. Subtracting vertex coordinates
defines edge vectors,

:&lt;math&gt;(g,1,1-g), (-g,1,g-1)&lt;/math&gt;

of the first face and

:&lt;math&gt;(g-1,g,1), (-g,-1,g-1)&lt;/math&gt;

of the other. [[Cross product]]s of the edges of the first face and second
face yield (not normalized) face [[Normal (geometry)|normal vectors]]

:&lt;math&gt;(2g-2,0,2g) \sim (g-1,0,g)&lt;/math&gt;
of the first and
:&lt;math&gt;(g^2-g+1,-g-(g-1)^2,1-g+g^2) = (2,-2,2)\sim (1,-1,1)&lt;/math&gt;
of the second face, using {{math|g&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;{{=}}1+g}}.

      <text bytes="2423" xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], '''non-Archimedean geometry'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Hartshorne]], ''Geometry: Euclid and beyond'' (2000), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; is any of a number of forms of [[geometry]] in which the [[axiom of Archimedes]] is negated. An example of such a geometry is the [[Dehn plane]]. Non-Archimedean geometries may, as the example indicates, have properties significantly different from [[Euclidean geometry]].

There are two senses in which the term may be used, referring to geometries over [[field (algebra)|field]]s which violate one of the two senses of the [[Archimedean property]] (i.e. with respect to order or magnitude).

== Geometry over a non-Archimedean ordered field ==

The first sense of the term is the geometry over a [[non-Archimedean ordered field]], or a subset thereof. The aforementioned Dehn plane takes the self-product of the finite portion of a certain non-Archimedean ordered field based on the field of [[rational function]]s. In this geometry, there are significant differences from Euclidean geometry; in particular, there are infinitely many parallels to a straight line through a point—so the [[parallel postulate]] fails—but the sum of the angles of a triangle is still a straight angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Hilbert | first1=David | author1-link=David Hilbert | title=The foundations of geometry | year=1902 | publisher=The Open Court Publishing Co., La Salle, Ill. | mr=0116216 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17384/17384-pdf.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intuitively, in such a space, the points on a line cannot be described by the real numbers or a subset thereof, and there exist segments of "infinite" or "infinitesimal" length.

== Geometry over a non-Archimedean valued field ==

The second sense of the term is the metric geometry over a non-Archimedean [[absolute value (algebra)|valued field]],&lt;ref&gt;Conrad, B. "Several approaches to non-archimedean geometry. In p-adic Geometry (Lectures from the 2007 Arizona Winter School). AMS University Lecture Series." ''Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, RI'' 41 (2008): 78.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[ultrametric space]]. In such a space, even more contradictions to Euclidean geometry result. For example, all triangles are isosceles, and overlapping [[ball (mathematics)|balls]] nest. An example of such a space is the [[p-adic numbers]].

Intuitively, in such a space, distances fail to "add up" or "accumulate".

      <text bytes="18845" xml:space="preserve">'''Line moiré''' is one type of [[moiré pattern]]; a pattern that appears when superposing two transparent layers containing correlated opaque patterns. Line moiré is the case when the superposed patterns comprise straight or curved lines. When moving the layer patterns, the moiré patterns transform or move at a faster speed. This effect is called optical moiré speedup.

==Superposition of layers with periodically repeating parallel lines==
[[File:070309-moire-a5-a4-parallel-lines.png|thumb|200px|Figure 1. Two layers with parallel lines]]

Simple moiré patterns can be observed when superposing two transparent layers comprising periodically repeating opaque parallel lines as shown in Figure 1. The lines of one layer are parallel to the lines of the second layer.

The superposition image does not change if transparent layers with their opaque patterns are inverted. When considering printed samples, one of the layers is denoted as the [[base layer]] and the other one as the revealing layer. It is assumed that the revealing layer is printed on a transparency and is superimposed on top of the base layer, which can be printed either on a transparency or on an opaque paper. The periods of the two layer patterns are close. We denote the period of the base layer as ''p''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; and the period of the revealing layer as ''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;.

The superposition image of Figure 1 outlines periodically repeating dark parallel bands, called moiré lines. Spacing between the moiré lines is much larger than the periods of lines in the two layers.

[[File:070309-moire-a5-a8-overlap-and-interleave.png|thumb|200px|Figure 2. Overlapping and interleaving zones]]

Light bands of the superposition image correspond to the zones where the lines of both layers overlap. The dark bands of the superposition image forming the moiré lines correspond to the zones where the lines of the two layers interleave, hiding the white background. The labels of Figure 2 show the passages from light zones with overlapping layer lines to dark zones with interleaving layer lines. The light and dark zones are periodically interchanging.

Figure 3 shows a detailed diagram of the superposition image between two adjacent zones with overlapping lines of the revealing and base layers (i.e., between two light bands).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The period ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; of moiré lines is the distance from one point where the lines of both layers overlap (at the bottom of the figure) to the next such point (at the top). Let us count the layer lines, starting from the bottom point. At the count 0 the lines of both layers overlap. Since in our case ''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;''p''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, for the same number of counted lines, the base layer lines with a long period advance faster than the revealing layer lines with a short period. At the halfway of the distance ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, the base layer lines are ahead the revealing layer lines by a half a period (''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;/2) of the revealing layer lines, due to which the lines are interleaving, forming a dark moiré band. At the full distance ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, the base layer lines are ahead of the revealing layer lines by a full period ''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, so the lines of the layers again overlap. The base layer lines gain the distance ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; with as many lines (''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;/''p''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;) as the number of the revealing layer lines (''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;/''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;) for the same distance minus one: ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;/''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;/''p''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; + 1. From here we obtain the well known formula for the period ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; of the superposition image:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

: &lt;math&gt;p_m=\frac{p_b \cdot p_r}{p_b - p_r}.&lt;/math&gt;
For the case when the revealing layer period is longer than the base layer period, the distance between moiré bands is the absolute value computed by the formula. The superposition of two layers comprising parallel lines forms an optical image comprising parallel moiré lines with a magnified period. According to the formula for computing ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, the closer the periods of the two layers, the stronger the magnification factor is.

The thicknesses of layer lines affect the overall darkness of the superposition image and the thickness of the moiré bands, but the period ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; does not depend on the layer lines’ thickness.

==Speedup of movements with moiré==
The moiré bands of Figure 1 will move if we displace the revealing layer. When the revealing layer moves perpendicularly to layer lines, the moiré bands move along the same axis, but several times faster than the movement of the revealing layer.

[[File:070309-moire-a5-a5-upward-movement.gif|thumb|250px|Figure 4. Slow movement of the revealing layer upward]]

The [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF animation]] shown in Figure 4 corresponds to a slow movement of the revealing layer. The GIF file repeatedly animates an upward movement of the revealing layer (perpendicular to layer lines) across a distance equal to ''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;. The animation demonstrates that the moiré lines of the superposition image move up at a speed, much faster than the movement speed of the revealing layer.

When the revealing layer is shifted up perpendicularly to the layer lines by one full period (''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;) of its pattern, the superposition optical image must be the same as the initial one. It means that the moiré lines traverse a distance equal to the period of the superposition image ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; while the revealing layer traverses the distance equal to its period ''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;. Assuming that the base layer is immobile (''v''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;=0), the following equation represents the ratio of the optical speed to the revealing layer’s speed:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{v_m}{v_r}=\frac{p_m}{p_r}.&lt;/math&gt;
By replacing ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; with its formula, we have&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv
| title = The basics of line moiré patterns and optical speedup
| author = Emin Gabrielyan
| date = 2007-03-08
| arxiv = physics/0703098
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{v_m}{v_r}=\frac{p_b}{p_b-p_r}.&lt;/math&gt;
In case the period of the revealing layer is longer than the period of the base layer, the optical image moves in the opposite direction. The negative value of the ratio computed according to this formula signifies a movement in the reverse direction.

==Superposition of layers with inclined lines==

Here we present patterns with inclined lines. When we are interested in optical speedup we can represent the case of inclined patterns such that the formulas for computing moiré periods and optical speedups remain valid in their current simplest form. For this purpose, the values of periods ''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;,  ''p''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; correspond to the distances between the lines along the axis of movements (the vertical axis in the animated example of Figure 4). When the layer lines are perpendicular to the movement axis, the periods (''p'') are equal to the distances (denoted as ''T'') between the lines (as in Figure 4). If the lines are inclined, the periods (''p'') along the axis of the movement are not equal to the distances (''T'') between the lines.

===Computing moiré lines’ inclination as function of the inclination of layers’ lines===

[[File:070309-moire-a5-a6-10-layer-lines-same-degree.png|thumb|200px|Figure 5. Identical inclination of layer lines]]

The superposition of two layers with identically inclined lines forms moiré lines inclined at the same angle. Figure 5 is obtained from Figure 1 with a vertical shearing. In Figure 5 the layer lines and the moiré lines are inclined by 10 degrees. Since the inclination is not a rotation, during the inclination the distance (''p'') between the layer lines along the vertical axis is conserved, but the true distance (''T'') between the lines (along an axis perpendicular to these lines) is changed. The difference between the vertical periods ''p''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, and the distances ''T''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is shown in the diagram of Figure 8.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:070309-moire-a5-a16-1-layers-with-same-cruves.png|thumb|200px|Figure 6. identical curves in all pattern]] --&gt;

The inclination degree of layer lines may change along the horizontal axis forming curves. The superposition of two layers with identical inclination pattern forms moiré curves with the same inclination pattern. In Figure 6 the inclination degree of layer lines gradually changes according to the following sequence of degrees (+30, –30, +30, –30, +30). Layer periods ''p''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; represent the distances between the curves along the vertical axis. The presented formulas for computing the period ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; (the vertical distance between the moiré curves) and the optical speedup (along the vertical axis) are valid for Figure 6.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:070309-moire-a5-a6-layer-lines.gif|thumb|250px|Figure 7. Changing inclination of revealing layer lines]] --&gt;

More interesting is the case when the inclination degrees of layer lines are not the same for the base and revealing layers. Figure 7 shows an animation of a superposition images where the inclination degree of base layer lines is constant (10 degrees), but the inclination of the revealing layer lines oscillates between 5 and 15 degrees. The periods of layers along the vertical axis ''p''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; are the same all the time. Correspondingly, the period ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; (along the vertical axis) computed with the basic formula also remains the same.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:070309-moire-a5-a19-inclination-diagram.png|thumb|500px|Figure 8. Computing the inclination angle of moiré lines]] --&gt;

Figure 8 helps to compute the inclination degree of moiré optical lines as a function of the inclination of the revealing and the base layer lines. We draw the layer lines schematically without showing their true thicknesses. The bold lines of the diagram inclined by ''α''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; degrees are the base layer lines. The bold lines inclined by ''α''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; degrees are the revealing layer lines. The base layer lines are vertically spaced by a distance equal to ''p''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, and the revealing layer lines are vertically spaced by a distance equal to ''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;. The distances ''T''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; represent the true space between the base layer and revealing layer lines, correspondingly. The intersections of the lines of the base and the revealing layers (marked in the figure by two arrows) lie on a central axis of a light moiré band. The dashed line of Figure 8 corresponds to the axis of the light moiré band. The inclination degree of moiré lines is therefore the inclination ''α''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; of the dashed line.

From Figure 8 we deduce the following two equations:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
    \tan \alpha_m=\frac{p_b+l \cdot \tan\alpha_b}{l} \\
    \tan \alpha_r=\frac{p_b-p_r+l \cdot \tan\alpha_b}{l}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
From these equations we deduce the equation for computing the inclination of moiré lines as a function of the inclinations of the base layer and the revealing layer lines:
:&lt;math&gt; \tan\alpha_m=\frac{p_b \cdot \tan\alpha_r - p_r \cdot \tan\alpha_b}{p_b-p_r} &lt;/math&gt;

===Deducing other known formulas===

The true pattern periods ''T''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; (along the axes perpendicular to pattern lines) are computed as follows (see Figure 8):
: &lt;math&gt;T_b=p_b \cdot \cos\alpha_b,\ T_r=p_r \cdot\cos\alpha_r,\ T_m=p_m \cdot\cos\alpha_m&lt;/math&gt;
From here, using the formula for computing tan(''α''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) with periods ''p'', we deduce a well known formula for computing the moiré angle ''α''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; with periods ''T'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

From formula for computing ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; we deduce another well known formula for computing the period ''T''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; of [[moiré pattern]] (along the axis perpendicular to moiré bands):
:&lt;math&gt;T_m=\frac{T_b \cdot T_r}{\sqrt{T_b^2+T_r^2-2 \cdot T_b \cdot T_r \cdot \cos(\alpha_r-\alpha_b)}}&lt;/math&gt;
In the particular case when ''T''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;=''T''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;=''T'', the formula for the period ''T''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is reduced into well known formula:
:&lt;math&gt;T_m=\frac{T}{2 \cdot \sin \left ( \frac{\alpha_r-\alpha_b}{2} \right )}&lt;/math&gt;
And the formula for computing α&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is reduced to:
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_m=90^\circ +\frac{\alpha_r+\alpha_b}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

===The revealing lines inclination as a function of the superposition image’s lines inclination===

Here is the equation for computing the revealing layer line inclination ''α''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; for a given base layer line inclination ''α''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, and a desired moiré line inclination ''α''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; \tan\alpha_r=\frac{p_r}{p_b} \cdot \tan\alpha_b+\left(1-\frac{p_r}{p_b}\right)\cdot \tan\alpha_m.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:070312-moire-a5-a16-2-curved-with-straight-base.png|thumb|200px|Figure 9. Moiré curves with straight base layer lines]]

For any given base layer line inclination, this equation permits us to obtain a desired moiré line inclination by properly choosing the revealing layer inclination. In Figure 6 we showed an example where the curves of layers follow an identical inclination pattern forming a superposition image with the same inclination pattern. The inclination degrees of the layers’ and moiré lines change along the horizontal axis according to the following sequence of alternating degree values (+30, –30, +30, –30, +30). In Figure 9 we obtain the same superposition pattern as in Figure 6, but with a base layer comprising straight lines inclined by –10 degrees. The revealing pattern of Figure 9 is computed by interpolating the curves into connected straight lines, where for each position along the horizontal axis, the revealing line’s inclination angle ''α''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is computed as a function of ''α''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; and ''α''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; according to the equation above.

Figure 9 demonstrates that the difference between the inclination angles of revealing and base layer lines has to be several times smaller than the difference between inclination angles of moiré and base layer lines.

[[File:070312-moire-a5-a16-3-mirrored-curves.png|thumb|200px|Figure 10. Inversed base layer and moiré lines]]

Another example forming the same superposition patterns as in Figure 6 and Figure 9 is shown in Figure 10. In Figure 10 the desired inclination pattern (+30, –30, +30, –30, +30) is obtained using a base layer with an inverted inclination pattern (–30, +30, –30, +30, –30).

[[File:070312-moire-a5-a16-same-curves-changing-layers.gif|thumb|250px|Figure 11. The same moiré curves with modifying layer patterns]]
[[File:Moiré.gif|438px|right|thumb|Effect on circular lines.]]

Figure 11 shows an animation where we obtain a superposition image with a constant inclination pattern of moiré lines (+30, –30, +30, –30, +30) for continuously modifying pairs of base and revealing layers. The base layer inclination pattern gradually changes and the revealing layer inclination pattern correspondingly adapts such that the superposition image’s inclination pattern remains the same.

[[Dimension|One-dimensional]] patterns may appear when superimposing an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] layer containing tiny horizontal [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]] lines on top of a layer containing a complex shape which is periodically repeating along the [[Cartesian coordinate system|vertical axis]]. 

==Description==
Shape moiré is sometimes referred as '''band moiré'''. The opaque layer with transparent lines is called the '''revealing layer'''. The layer containing the periodically repeating shapes is called the '''base layer'''. The period of shapes in the base layer is denoted as ''p''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;. The period of transparent lines in the revealing layer is denoted as ''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;. The periods of both layers must be sufficiently close. The superimposition image reveals the shapes of the base layer stretched along the vertical axis. The [[Magnification|magnified]] shapes appear periodically along the vertical axis. The dimensions along the horizontal axis are not changed. If the complex shape of the base layer is a sequence of symbols (e.g. a horizontal text) compressed along the vertical axis, then the superimposition of the revealing layer can restore the original proportions of these symbols. The size along the vertical axis, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, of the magnified optical shape is expressed by the following formula:
:&lt;math&gt;p_m=-\frac{p_b \cdot p_r}{p_b-p_r}&lt;/math&gt;
Negative values of ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; signify mirrored appearance (the magnified shapes will be inverted along the vertical axis) of the stretched shapes.

When the revealing layer is moved along the vertical axis, the magnified shapes move along the vertical axis at a faster speed. The speedup factor is expressed by the following formula:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{v_m}{v_r}=-\frac{p_b}{p_b-p_r}&lt;/math&gt;
Negative values of ''v''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; / ''v''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; signify the movement of optical shapes in reverse direction.

==Examples==
When ''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, the magnified shapes appear normally, but they move in reverse direction compared to the movement of the revealing layer. See the figure below:

[[Image:070320-a6-shape-moire-pr-gt-pb.gif]]

When ''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, the magnified shapes appear inverted along the vertical axis, but they move in the same direction as the revealing layer. See the figure below:

[[Image:070320-shape-moire-a6-pr-lt-pb.gif]]

==Line moiré==
[[Line moiré]] can be considered as a particular case of shape moiré when the shape embedded in the base layer is simply a straight or curved line.

[[File:quadrilateral_congruence.png|thumb|300px|The orange and green quadrilaterals are congruent; the blue one is not congruent to them. Congruence between the orange and green ones is established by the facts that side BC corresponds to (in this case of congruence, equals in length) JK, CD corresponds to KL, DA corresponds to LI, and AB corresponds to IJ, while angle C corresponds to (equals) angle K, D corresponds to L, A corresponds to I, and B corresponds to J.]]

In [[geometry]], the tests for [[Congruence (geometry)|congruence]] and [[Similarity (geometry)|similarity]] involve comparing '''corresponding sides''' and '''corresponding angles''' of [[polygon]]s. In these tests, each [[edge (geometry)|side]] and each [[angle]] in one polygon is paired with a side or angle in the second polygon, taking care to preserve the order of adjacency. 

For example, if one polygon has sequential sides ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', and ''e'' and the other has sequential sides   ''v'', ''w'', ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'', and if ''b'' and ''w'' are corresponding sides, then side ''a'' (adjacent to ''b'') must correspond to either ''v'' or ''x'' (both adjacent to ''w''). If ''a'' and ''v'' correspond to each other, then ''c'' corresponds to ''x'', ''d'' corresponds to ''y'', and ''e'' corresponds to ''z''; hence the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; element of the sequence ''abcde'' corresponds to the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; element of the sequence ''vwxyz'' for ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;4,&amp;nbsp;5. On the other hand, if in addition to ''b'' corresponding to ''w'' we have ''c'' corresponding to ''v'', then the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; element of ''abcde'' corresponds to the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; element of the reverse sequence ''xwvzy''.

Congruence tests look for all pairs of corresponding sides to be equal in length, though except in the case of the [[triangle]] this is not sufficient to establish congruence (as exemplified by a [[square]] and a [[rhombus]] that have the same side length).  Similarity tests look at whether the [[ratio]]s of the lengths of each pair of corresponding sides are equal, though again this is not sufficient. In either case equality of corresponding angles is also necessary; equality (or proportionality) of corresponding sides combined with equality of corresponding angles is necessary and sufficient for congruence (or similarity). The corresponding angles as well as the corresponding sides are defined as appearing in the same sequence, so for example if in a polygon with the side sequence ''abcde'' and another with the corresponding side sequence ''vwxyz'' we have vertex angle ''A'' appearing between sides ''a'' and ''b'' then its corresponding vertex angle ''V'' must appear between sides ''v'' and  ''w''.

      <text bytes="12163" xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], a '''Laguerre plane''' is one of the [[Benz plane]]s: the [[Möbius plane]], Laguerre plane and [[Minkowski plane]], named after the [[France|French]] mathematician  [[Edmond Nicolas Laguerre]].
[[Image:Laguerre-2d3d-model.svg|350px|thumb|classical Laguerre plane: 2d/3d-model]]
Essentially the classical Laguerre plane is an [[incidence structure]] that describes the incidence behaviour of the curves &lt;math&gt;y=ax^2+bx+c&lt;/math&gt; , i.e. parabolas and lines, in the [[real number|real]] [[affine plane]]. In order to simplify the structure, to any curve  &lt;math&gt;y=ax^2+bx+c&lt;/math&gt; the point &lt;math&gt;(\infty,a)&lt;/math&gt; is added. A further advantage of this completion is: The plane geometry of the completed parabolas/lines is [[isomorphic]] to the geometry of the [[plane section]]s of a [[cylinder]] (see below).

== The classical real Laguerre plane ==

Originally the classical Laguerre plane was defined as the geometry of the oriented lines and circles in the real Euclidean plane (see &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Walter|last=Benz|author-link=Walter Benz|title=Vorlesungen über Geometrie der Algebren |origyear= 1973|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|place=Heidelberg|page=11|isbn=9783642886713|year=2013|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Here we prefer the parabola model of the classical Laguerre plane.

We define:

&lt;math&gt; \mathcal P:=\R^2\cup (\{\infty\}\times\R), \ \infty \notin \R, &lt;/math&gt; the set of '''points''',
&lt;math&gt;  \mathcal Z:=\{\{(x,y)\in \R^2 \mid y=ax^2+bx+c\}\cup\{(\infty,a)\} \mid a,b,c \in \R\}&lt;/math&gt; the set of '''cycles'''.

The incidence structure &lt;math&gt; (\mathcal P,\mathcal Z, \in) &lt;/math&gt; is called '''classical Laguerre plane'''.

The point set is &lt;math&gt;\R^2&lt;/math&gt; plus a copy of &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt; (see figure). Any parabola/line &lt;math&gt;y=ax^2+bx+c &lt;/math&gt; gets the additional point  &lt;math&gt;(\infty,a)&lt;/math&gt;.

Points with the same x-coordinate cannot be connected by curves &lt;math&gt;y=ax^2+bx+c &lt;/math&gt;. Hence we define:

Two points &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; are '''parallel''' (&lt;math&gt;A\parallel B&lt;/math&gt;)
if &lt;math&gt;A=B&lt;/math&gt; or there is no cycle containing &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.

For the description of the classical real Laguerre plane above two points &lt;math&gt;(a_1,a_2), (b_1,b_2)&lt;/math&gt; are parallel if and only if &lt;math&gt;a_1=b_1&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\parallel&lt;/math&gt; is an [[equivalence relation]], similar to the parallelity of lines.

The incidence structure &lt;math&gt; (\mathcal P,\mathcal Z, \in) &lt;/math&gt; has the following properties:

'''Lemma:'''
:* For any three points &lt;math&gt;A,B,C&lt;/math&gt;, pairwise not parallel, there is exactly one cycle &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;A,B,C&lt;/math&gt;.
:* For any point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and any cycle &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; there is exactly one point &lt;math&gt;P'\in z&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; P\parallel P'&lt;/math&gt;.
:* For any cycle &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, any point &lt;math&gt;P\in z&lt;/math&gt; and any point &lt;math&gt;Q\notin z&lt;/math&gt; that is not parallel to &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; there is exactly one cycle &lt;math&gt;z'&lt;/math&gt; through &lt;math&gt;P,Q&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;z\cap z'=\{P\}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z'&lt;/math&gt; '''touch''' each other at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;''.
[[File:Laguerre-stereogr-proj.svg|250px|thumb|Laguerre-plane: stereographic projection of the x-z-plane onto a cylinder]]
Similar to the sphere model of the classical [[Moebius plane]] there is a '''cylinder model''' for the classical Laguerre plane:

&lt;math&gt; (\mathcal P,\mathcal Z, \in) &lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to the geometry of plane sections of a circular cylinder in &lt;math&gt;\R^3&lt;/math&gt; .

The following mapping &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is a projection with center &lt;math&gt;(0,1,0)&lt;/math&gt; that maps the x-z-plane onto the cylinder with the equation &lt;math&gt;u^2+v^2-v=0&lt;/math&gt;, axis &lt;math&gt;(0,\tfrac{1}{2},..)&lt;/math&gt; and radius &lt;math&gt;r=\tfrac{1}{2}\ :&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi: \ (x,z) \rightarrow (\frac{x}{1+x^2},\frac{x^2}{1+x^2},\frac{z}{1+x^2})=(u,v,w)\ .&lt;/math&gt;
*The points &lt;math&gt;(0,1,a)&lt;/math&gt; (line on the cylinder through the center) appear not as images. 
*&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; projects the  ''parabola/line'' with equation &lt;math&gt;z=ax^2+bx+c&lt;/math&gt; into the plane &lt;math&gt;w-a=bu+(a-c)(v-1)&lt;/math&gt;. So, the image of the parabola/line is the plane section of the cylinder with a non perpendicular plane and hence a circle/ellipse without point &lt;math&gt;(0,1,a)&lt;/math&gt;. The parabolas/line &lt;math&gt;z=ax^2+a&lt;/math&gt; are mapped onto (horizontal) circles.
*A line(a=0) is mapped onto a circle/Ellipse through center &lt;math&gt;(0,1,0)&lt;/math&gt; and a parabola ( &lt;math&gt;a\ne0&lt;/math&gt;) onto a circle/ellipse that do not contain &lt;math&gt;(0,1,0)&lt;/math&gt;.

==The axioms of a Laguerre plane==

The Lemma above gives rise to the following definition:

Let &lt;math&gt; \mathcal L:=(\mathcal P,\mathcal Z, \in) &lt;/math&gt;  be an incidence structure with '''point''' set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal P &lt;/math&gt; and set of '''cycles''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal Z&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
Two points &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; are '''parallel''' (&lt;math&gt;A\parallel B&lt;/math&gt;) if &lt;math&gt;A=B&lt;/math&gt; or there is no cycle containing &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal L&lt;/math&gt; is called '''Laguerre plane''' if the following axioms hold:
[[File:Laguerre-axiome.svg|300px|thumb|Laguerre-plane: axioms]]
:'''B1:''' For any three points &lt;math&gt;A,B,C&lt;/math&gt;, pairwise not parallel, there is exactly one cycle &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; that contains &lt;math&gt;A,B,C&lt;/math&gt;.

:'''B2:''' For any point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and any cycle &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; there is exactly one point &lt;math&gt;P'\in z&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;P\parallel P'&lt;/math&gt;.

:'''B3:''' For any cycle &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, any point &lt;math&gt;P\in z&lt;/math&gt; and any point &lt;math&gt;Q\notin z&lt;/math&gt; that is not parallel to &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; there is exactly one cycle &lt;math&gt;z'&lt;/math&gt; through &lt;math&gt;P,Q&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;z\cap z'=\{P\}&lt;/math&gt;,
: i.e. &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z'&lt;/math&gt; '''touch''' each other at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

:'''B4:''' Any cycle contains at least three points, there is at least one cycle. There are at least four points not on a cycle.

Four points &lt;math&gt;A,B,C,D&lt;/math&gt; are '''concyclic''' if there is a cycle &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;A,B,C,D \in z&lt;/math&gt;.

From the definition of relation &lt;math&gt;\parallel&lt;/math&gt; and axiom '''B2''' we get

'''Lemma:'''
Relation &lt;math&gt;\parallel&lt;/math&gt; is an [[equivalence relation]].

Following the cylinder model of the classical Laguerre-plane we introduce the denotation:

a) For &lt;math&gt;P\in \mathcal P&lt;/math&gt; we set &lt;math&gt;\overline{P}:=\{Q\in \mathcal P \ | \ P\parallel Q\}&lt;/math&gt;.
b) An equivalence class &lt;math&gt;\overline{P}&lt;/math&gt; is called '''generator'''.

For the classical Laguerre plane a generator is a line parallel to the y-axis (plane model) or a line on the cylinder (space model).

The connection to linear geometry is given by the following definition:

For a Laguerre plane   &lt;math&gt; \mathcal L:=(\mathcal P,\mathcal Z, \in) &lt;/math&gt; we define the local structure
: &lt;math&gt; \mathcal A _P:= (\mathcal P\setminus\{\overline{P}\},\{z\setminus\{\overline{P}\} \ | \ P\in z\in\mathcal Z\}
\cup \{\overline{Q} \ | \ Q\in \mathcal P\setminus\{\overline{P}\}, \in)&lt;/math&gt;

and call it the  '''residue''' at point P.

In the plane model of the classical Laguerre plane  &lt;math&gt; \mathcal A _\infty&lt;/math&gt; is the real affine plane  &lt;math&gt;\R^2&lt;/math&gt;.
In general we get

'''Theorem:''' Any residue of a Laguerre plane is an [[affine plane]].

And the equivalent definition of a Laguerre plane:

'''Theorem:'''
An incidence structure together with an equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;\parallel&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal P&lt;/math&gt; is a
Laguerre plane if and only if for any point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; the residue &lt;math&gt; \mathcal A _P &lt;/math&gt; is an affine plane.

==Finite Laguerre planes==

[[File:Laguerre-min-model.svg|300px|thumb|minimal model of a Laguerre plane (only 4 of 8 cycles are shown)]]
The following incidence structure is a '''minimal model''' of a Laguerre plane:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal P:=\{A_1,A_2,B_1,B_2,C_1,C_2\} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal Z:=\{\{A_i,B_j,C_k\} \ | \ i,j,k=1,2\} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;A_1\parallel A_2,\ B_1\parallel B_2,\ C_1\parallel C_2 \ .&lt;/math&gt;
Hence &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal P|= 6&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal Z|=8 \ .&lt;/math&gt;

For finite Laguerre planes, i.e. &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal P|&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, we get:

'''Lemma:'''
For any cycles &lt;math&gt;z_1,z_2&lt;/math&gt; and any generator &lt;math&gt;\overline{P}&lt;/math&gt; of a '''finite''' Laguerre plane
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal L:=(\mathcal P,\mathcal Z, \in)&lt;/math&gt; we have:
: &lt;math&gt;|z_1|=|z_2|=|\overline{P}|+1&lt;/math&gt;.

For a finite Laguerre plane &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L:=(\mathcal P,\mathcal Z, \in)&lt;/math&gt; and a cycle &lt;math&gt;z\in \mathcal Z&lt;/math&gt; the integer &lt;math&gt;n:=|z|-1&lt;/math&gt; is called '''order''' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L&lt;/math&gt;.

From combinatorics we get

'''Lemma:'''
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L:=(\mathcal P,\mathcal Z, \in)&lt;/math&gt; be a Laguerre—plane of '''order''' &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Then
:a) any residue &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A_P&lt;/math&gt; is an affine plane of order &lt;math&gt;n \quad,&lt;/math&gt;  b) &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal P|=n^2+n, &lt;/math&gt;  c) &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal Z|=n^3.&lt;/math&gt;

==Miquelian Laguerre planes==

Unlike Moebius planes the formal generalization of the classical model of a Laguerre plane, i.e. replacing &lt;math&gt;\R &lt;/math&gt; by an arbitrary field &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, leads '''in any case''' to an example of a Laguerre plane.

'''Theorem:'''
For a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] &lt;math&gt; K &lt;/math&gt;  and
: &lt;math&gt; \mathcal P:=K^2 \cup &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(\{\infty\}\times K), \ \infty \notin K &lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal Z:=\{\{(x,y)\in K^2 \ | \ y=ax^2+bx+c\}\cup\{(\infty,a)\} \ | \ a,b,c \in K\}&lt;/math&gt; the incidence structure
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal L(K):= (\mathcal P,\mathcal Z, \in)&lt;/math&gt; is a Laguerre plane with the following parallel relation: &lt;math&gt;(a_1,a_2) \parallel (b_1,b_2)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;a_1=b_1&lt;/math&gt;.

Similar to a Möbius plane the Laguerre version of the Theorem of Miquel holds:
[[File:Theorem-of-miquel.svg|300px|thumb|Theorem of Miquel (circles drawn instead of parabolas)]]

'''Theorem of MIQUEL:'''
For the Laguerre plane &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L(K) &lt;/math&gt; the following is true:

:If for any 8 pairwise not parallel points &lt;math&gt;P_1,\ldots,P_8&lt;/math&gt; that can be assigned to the vertices of a cube such that the points in 5 faces correspond to concyclical quadruples then the sixth quadruple of points is concyclical, too.
(For a better overview in the figure there are circles drawn instead of parabolas)

The importance of the Theorem of Miquel shows the following theorem, which is due to v. d. Waerden, Smid and Chen:

'''Theorem:''' Only a Laguerre plane &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L(K) &lt;/math&gt; satisfies the theorem of Miquel.

Because of the last Theorem &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L(K) &lt;/math&gt; is called a '''miquelian Laguerre plane'''.

'''Remark:''' The '''minimal model''' of a Laguerre plane is miquelian.&lt;br /&gt;
: It is isomorphic to the Laguerre plane &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L(K) &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; K = GF(2)&lt;/math&gt; (field &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;).

'''Remark:''' A suitable [[stereographic projection]] shows: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L(K) &lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to the geometry of the plane sections on a quadric cylinder over field &lt;math&gt; K &lt;/math&gt;.

==Ovoidal Laguerre planes ==
There are a lot of Laguerre planes that are '''not miquelian''' (see weblink below). The class that is most similar to miquelian Laguerre planes are the '''ovoidal Laguerre planes'''. An ovoidal Laguerre plane is the geometry of the plane sections of a cylinder that is constructed by using an [[quadratic set#Definition of an oval and an ovoid|oval]] instead of a non degenerate conic. An oval is a [[quadratic set]] and bears the same geometric properties as a non degenerate conic in a projective plane: 1) a line intersects an oval in zero, one, or two points and 2) at any point there is a unique tangent. A simple oval in the real plane can be constructed by glueing together two suitable halves of different ellipses, such that the result is not a conic. Even in the finite case there exist ovals (see [[quadratic set]]).

In mathematics, a '''Minkowski plane''' (named after [[Hermann Minkowski]]) is one of the [[Benz plane]]s (the others being [[Möbius plane]] and [[Laguerre plane]]).

==Classical real Minkowski plane==
[[Image:Minkowski-2d3d-model.svg|300px|thumb|classical Minkowski plane: 2d/3d-model]]
Applying the [[pseudo-euclidean]] distance &lt;math&gt;d(P_1,P_2)=(x'_1-x'_2)^2-(y'_1-y'_2)^2&lt;/math&gt; on two points &lt;math&gt;P_i=(x'_i,y'_i)&lt;/math&gt; (instead of the euclidean distance) we get the geometry of ''hyperbolas'', because a pseudo-euclidean circle &lt;math&gt;\{P\in \R^2 \ | \ d(P,M)=r\}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[hyperbola]] with midpoint &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. 

By a transformation of coordinates &lt;math&gt;x_i=x'_i+y'_i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y_i=x'_i-y'_i&lt;/math&gt;, the pseudo-euclidean distance can be rewritten as &lt;math&gt;d(P_1,P_2)=(x_1-x_2)(y_1-y_2)&lt;/math&gt;. The hyperbolas then have [[asymptotes]] parallel to the non-primed coordinate axes.

The following completion (see Möbius and Laguerre planes) ''homogenizes'' the geometry of hyperbolas:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal P:=(\R\cup \{\infty\})^2=
\R^2 \cup (\{\infty\} \times\R) \cup (\R\times\{\infty\}) \ 
     \cup \{(\infty,\infty)\} \ ,
 \ \infty \notin \R&lt;/math&gt;, the set of '''points''',
: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal Z:=\{\{(x,y)\in \R^2 \ | \ y=ax+b\}\cup\{(\infty,\infty)\} \ | 
                           \ a,b \in \R, a\ne 0\}&lt;/math&gt;
::: &lt;math&gt;\cup \{\{(x,y)\in \R^2\ | y=\frac{a}{x-b}+c,x\ne b\}
\cup \{(b,\infty),(\infty,c)\} \ | \ a,b,c \in \R, a\ne 0\},&lt;/math&gt; the set of '''cycles'''.

The [[incidence structure]] &lt;math&gt;({\mathcal P},{\mathcal Z},\in)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''classical real Minkowski plane'''.

The set of points consists of &lt;math&gt;\R^2&lt;/math&gt;, two copies of &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt; and the point &lt;math&gt;(\infty,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;.

Any line &lt;math&gt;y=ax+b ,a\ne0&lt;/math&gt; is completed by point &lt;math&gt;(\infty,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;, any hyperbola
&lt;math&gt; y=\frac{a}{x-b}+c,a\ne0 &lt;/math&gt; by the two points &lt;math&gt;(b,\infty),(\infty,c)&lt;/math&gt; (see figure).

Two points &lt;math&gt;(x_1,y_1)\ne(x_2,y_2)&lt;/math&gt; can not be connected by a cycle if and only if
&lt;math&gt;x_1=x_2&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y_1=y_2&lt;/math&gt;. 

We define:
Two points &lt;math&gt;P_1,P_2&lt;/math&gt; are '''(+)-parallel''' (&lt;math&gt;P_1\parallel_+ P_2&lt;/math&gt;) if &lt;math&gt;x_1=x_2&lt;/math&gt; and '''(−)-parallel''' (&lt;math&gt;P_1\parallel_- P_2&lt;/math&gt;) if &lt;math&gt;y_1=y_2&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
Both these relations are [[equivalence relations]] on the set of points.

Two points &lt;math&gt;P_1,P_2&lt;/math&gt; are called '''parallel''' (&lt;math&gt;P_1\parallel P_2&lt;/math&gt;) if
&lt;math&gt;P_1\parallel_+ P_2&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;P_1\parallel_- P_2&lt;/math&gt;.

From the definition above we find:

'''Lemma:'''
:*For any pair of non parallel points &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; there is exactly one point &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;A\parallel_+ C \parallel_- B&lt;/math&gt;.
:*For any point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and any cycle &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; there are exactly two points &lt;math&gt;A,B \in z&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;A\parallel_+ P \parallel_- B&lt;/math&gt;.
:*For any three points &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, pairwise non parallel, there is exactly one cycle &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; that contains &lt;math&gt;A,B,C&lt;/math&gt;.
:*For any cycle &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, any point &lt;math&gt;P\in z&lt;/math&gt; and any point &lt;math&gt;Q, P \not\parallel Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q\notin z&lt;/math&gt; there exists exactly one cycle &lt;math&gt;z'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;z\cap z'=\{P\}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; '''touches''' &lt;math&gt;z'&lt;/math&gt; at point P.

Like the classical Möbius and Laguerre planes Minkowski planes can be described as the geometry of plane sections of a suitable quadric. But in this case the quadric lives in '''projective''' 3-space: The classical real Minkowski plane is isomorphic to the geometry of plane sections of a [[hyperboloid of one sheet]] (not degenerated quadric of index 2).

==The axioms of a Minkowski plane==

Let &lt;math&gt; \left( {\mathcal P} , {\mathcal Z} ; \parallel_+ , \parallel_- , \in \right) &lt;/math&gt; be an incidence structure with the set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal P&lt;/math&gt; of points, the set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal Z&lt;/math&gt; of cycles and two equivalence relations &lt;math&gt;\parallel_+&lt;/math&gt; ((+)-parallel) and &lt;math&gt;\parallel_-&lt;/math&gt; ((−)-parallel) on set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal P&lt;/math&gt;.  For &lt;math&gt;P\in \mathcal P&lt;/math&gt; we define:
&lt;math&gt; \overline{P}_+ := \left\{ \left. Q \in \mathcal P \ \right| \ Q\parallel_+ P \right\} &lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt; \overline{P}_- := \left\{ \left. Q \in \mathcal P \ \right| \ Q\parallel_- P \right\} &lt;/math&gt;.
An equivalence class &lt;math&gt;\overline{P}_+&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\overline{P}_-&lt;/math&gt; is called '''(+)-generator'''
and '''(−)-generator''', respectively. (For the space model of the classical Minkowski plane a generator is a line on the hyperboloid.)&lt;br /&gt;
Two points &lt;math&gt; A , B &lt;/math&gt; are called '''parallel''' (&lt;math&gt; A \parallel B &lt;/math&gt;) if &lt;math&gt; A \parallel_+ B &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; A \parallel_- B&lt;/math&gt;.

An incidence structure &lt;math&gt; {\mathfrak M} := ( {\mathcal P} , {\mathcal Z} ; \parallel_+ , \parallel_- , \in ) &lt;/math&gt; is called '''Minkowski plane''' if the following axioms hold:&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Minkowski-axioms-c1-c2.svg|thumb|Minkowski-axioms-c1-c2]]
[[File:Minkowski-axioms-c3-c4.svg|thumb|Minkowski-axioms-c3-c4]]
* '''C1''': For any pair of non parallel points &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; there is exactly one point &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;A\parallel_+ C \parallel_- B &lt;/math&gt;.
* '''C2''': For any point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and any cycle &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; there are exactly two points &lt;math&gt; A , B \in z&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;A\parallel_+ P \parallel_- B &lt;/math&gt;.
* '''C3''': For any three points &lt;math&gt;A,B,C&lt;/math&gt;, pairwise non parallel, there is exactly one cycle &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; which contains &lt;math&gt; A , B , C &lt;/math&gt;.
* '''C4''': For any cycle &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, any point &lt;math&gt;P\in z&lt;/math&gt; and any point &lt;math&gt; Q, P \not\parallel Q &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q\notin z&lt;/math&gt; there exists exactly one cycle &lt;math&gt;z'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; z \cap z' = \{ P \} &lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; '''touches''' &lt;math&gt;z'&lt;/math&gt; at point &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt;.
* '''C5''': Any cycle contains at least 3 points. There is at least one cycle &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and a point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; not in &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;.

For investigations the following statements on parallel classes (equivalent to C1, C2 respectively) are advantageous.
:'''C1′''': For any two points &lt;math&gt; A , B &lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt; \left| \overline{A}_+ \cap\overline{B}_- \right| = 1 &lt;/math&gt;.
:'''C2′''': For any point &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; and any cycle &lt;math&gt; z &lt;/math&gt; we have: &lt;math&gt; \left| \overline{P}_+ \cap z \right | = 1 = \left| \overline{P}_- \cap z \right| &lt;/math&gt;.

First consequences of the axioms are

'''Lemma:''' For a Minkowski plane &lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak M}&lt;/math&gt; the following is true
:a) Any point is contained in at least one cycle.
:b) Any generator contains at least 3 points.
:c) Two points can be connected by a cycle if and only if they are non parallel.

Analogously to Möbius and Laguerre planes we get the connection to the linear
geometry via the residues.

For a Minkowski plane &lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak M}=({\mathcal P},{\mathcal Z};\parallel_+,\parallel_-,\in)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P \in \mathcal P&lt;/math&gt; we define the local structure
: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak A_P:= (\mathcal P\setminus\overline{P},\{z\setminus\{\overline{P}\} \ | \ P\in z\in\mathcal Z\}
\cup \{E\setminus \overline{P} \ | \ E\in {\mathcal E}\setminus\{\overline{P}_+,\overline{P}_-\}\}, \in)&lt;/math&gt;
and call it the '''residue at point P'''.

For the classical Minkowski plane &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak A_{(\infty,\infty)}&lt;/math&gt; is the real affine plane &lt;math&gt;\R^2&lt;/math&gt;.

An immediate consequence of axioms C1 to C4 and C1′, C2′ are the following two theorems.

'''Theorem''': For a Minkowski plane &lt;math&gt; {\mathfrak M} = ( {\mathcal P} , {\mathcal Z} ; \parallel_+ , \parallel , \in ) &lt;/math&gt; any residue is an affine plane.

'''Theorem''':
Let be &lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak M}=({\mathcal P},{\mathcal Z};\parallel_+,\parallel_-,\in)&lt;/math&gt; an incidence structure with two equivalence relations &lt;math&gt;\parallel_+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\parallel_-&lt;/math&gt; on the set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal P&lt;/math&gt; of points (see above).
:&lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak M}&lt;/math&gt; is a Minkowski plane if and only if for any point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; the residue &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak A_P&lt;/math&gt; is an affine plane.

===Minimal model===
[[File:Minkowski-minimal-model.svg|300px|thumb|Minkowski plane: minimal model]]

The '''minimal model''' of a Minkowski plane can be established over the set
&lt;math&gt;\overline{K}:=\{0,1,\infty\}&lt;/math&gt; of three elements:

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal {P}:= {\overline{K}}^2 \qquad &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal Z:= \{ \{ (a_1,b_1),(a_2,b_2),(a_3,b_3) \} | &lt;/math&gt; 

&lt;math&gt; | \{a_1,a_2,a_3\} = \{b_1,b_2,b_3\}=\overline{K} \} =  &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\{ \{ (0,0),(1,1),(\infty,\infty) \} ,&lt;/math&gt; 
&lt;math&gt; \{ (0,0),(1,\infty),(\infty,1) \}, &lt;/math&gt; 
&lt;math&gt; \{ (0,1),(1,0),(\infty,\infty) \}, &lt;/math&gt; 
&lt;math&gt; \{ (0,1),(1,\infty),(\infty,0) \}, &lt;/math&gt; 
&lt;math&gt; \{ (0,\infty),(1,1),(\infty,0) \}, &lt;/math&gt; 
&lt;math&gt; \{ (0,\infty),(1,0),(\infty,1) \}\} &lt;/math&gt; 

Parallel points:

&lt;math&gt; (x_1,y_1) \parallel_+ (x_2,y_2) &lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt; x_1 = x_2 &lt;/math&gt; 

&lt;math&gt;(x_1,y_1)\parallel_- (x_2,y_2)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt; y_1 = y_2 &lt;/math&gt;.

Hence: &lt;math&gt; \left| \mathcal P \right| = 9 &lt;/math&gt;
and  &lt;math&gt; \left| \mathcal Z \right|  = 6 &lt;/math&gt;.

===Finite Minkowski-planes===
For finite Minkowski-planes we get from C1′, C2′:

'''Lemma''':
Let be &lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak M}=({\mathcal P},{\mathcal Z};\parallel_+,\parallel_-,\in)&lt;/math&gt; a finite Minkowski plane, i.e. &lt;math&gt; \left| \mathcal P \right| &lt; \infty &lt;/math&gt;. For any pair of cycles &lt;math&gt; z_1 , z_2 &lt;/math&gt; and any pair of generators &lt;math&gt; e_1 , e_2 &lt;/math&gt; we have:
&lt;math&gt; \left| z_1 \right| = \left| z_2 \right| = \left| e_1 \right| = \left| e_2 \right| &lt;/math&gt;.

This gives rise of the '''definition''':&lt;br /&gt;
For a finite Minkowski plane &lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak M}&lt;/math&gt; and a cycle &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak M}&lt;/math&gt; we call the integer &lt;math&gt; n = \left| z \right| - 1 &lt;/math&gt; the '''order''' of &lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak M}&lt;/math&gt;.

Simple combinatorial considerations yield

'''Lemma''':
For a finite Minkowski plane &lt;math&gt; {\mathfrak M} = ({\mathcal P} , {\mathcal Z} ; \parallel_+ , \parallel_- , \in ) &lt;/math&gt; the following is true:
: a) Any residue (affine plane) has order &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.
: b) &lt;math&gt; \left| \mathcal P \right| = ( n + 1 ) ^2 &lt;/math&gt;,  
: c) &lt;math&gt; \left| \mathcal Z \right| = ( n + 1 ) n ( n - 1 ) &lt;/math&gt;.

==Miquelian Minkowski planes==

We get the most important examples of Minkowski planes by generalizing the classical real model: Just replace &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt; by an arbitrary [[Field (mathematics)|field]] &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; then we get ''in any case'' a Minkowski plane &lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak M}(K)=({\mathcal P},{\mathcal Z};\parallel_+,\parallel_-,\in)&lt;/math&gt;.

Analogously to Möbius and Laguerre planes the Theorem of Miquel is a characteristic property of a Minkowski plane &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak M (K)&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Theorem-of-miquel.svg|300px|thumb|Theorem of Miquel]]
'''Theorem (Miquel):''' For the Minkowski plane &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak M (K)&lt;/math&gt; the following is true:
: If for any 8 pairwise not parallel points &lt;math&gt;P_1,...,P_8 &lt;/math&gt; which can be assigned to the vertices of a cube such that the points in 5 faces correspond to concyclical quadruples than the sixth quadruple of points is concyclical, too.

(For a better overview in the figure there are circles drawn instead of hyperbolas.)

'''Theorem (Chen):''' Only a Minkowski plane &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak M (K)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the theorem of Miquel.

Because of the last theorem &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak M(K) &lt;/math&gt; is called a '''miquelian Minkowski plane'''.

'''Remark:''' The '''minimal model''' of a Minkowski plane is miquelian.
: It is isomorphic to the Minkowski plane &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak M(K) &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; K = \operatorname{GF}(2)&lt;/math&gt; (field &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;).

An astonishing result is

'''Theorem (Heise):'''  Any Minkowski plane of ''even'' order is miquelian.

'''Remark:''' A suitable [[stereographic projection]] shows: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak M(K) &lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic
to the geometry of the plane sections on a hyperboloid of one sheet ([[quadric]] of index 2) in projective 3-space over field &lt;math&gt; K &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Remark:''' There are a lot of Minkowski planes that are '''not miquelian''' (s. weblink below). But there are no "ovoidal Minkowski" planes, in difference to Möbius and Laguerre planes. Because any [[quadratic set]] of index 2 in projective 3-space is a quadric (see [[quadratic set]]).

      <text bytes="5732" xml:space="preserve">In mathematics, a '''quadratic set''' is a set of points in a [[projective space]] that bears the same essential incidence properties as a quadric ([[conic section]] in a projective plane, [[sphere]] or [[cone]] or [[hyperboloid]] in a projective space).

== Definition of a quadratic set==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak P=({\mathcal P},{\mathcal G},\in)&lt;/math&gt; be a projective space. A '''quadratic set''' is a non-empty subset &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal Q}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal P}&lt;/math&gt; for which the following two conditions hold: 
:'''(QS1)''' Every line &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal G}&lt;/math&gt; intersects &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal Q}&lt;/math&gt; in at most two points or is contained in &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal Q}&lt;/math&gt;.
::(&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is called '''exterior''' to &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal Q}&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;|g\cap {\mathcal Q}|=0&lt;/math&gt;, '''tangent''' to &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal Q}&lt;/math&gt; if either &lt;math&gt;|g\cap {\mathcal Q}|=1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;g\cap {\mathcal Q}=g&lt;/math&gt;, and '''secant''' to &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal Q}&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;|g\cap {\mathcal Q}|=2&lt;/math&gt;.) 
:'''(QS2)''' For any point &lt;math&gt;P\in {\mathcal Q}&lt;/math&gt; the union &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal Q}_P&lt;/math&gt; of all tangent lines through &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a [[hyperplane]] or the entire space &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal P}&lt;/math&gt;.

A quadratic set &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal Q}&lt;/math&gt; is called '''non-degenerate''' if for every point &lt;math&gt;P\in {\mathcal Q}&lt;/math&gt;, the set &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal Q}_P&lt;/math&gt; is a hyperplane.

A '''Pappian projective space''' is a projective space in which [[Pappus's hexagon theorem]] holds.

The following result, due to [[Francis Buekenhout]], is an astonishing statement for finite projective spaces.

: '''Theorem:''' Let be &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak P_n&lt;/math&gt; a ''finite'' projective space of dimension &lt;math&gt;n\ge 3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal Q}&lt;/math&gt; a non-degenerate quadratic set that contains lines. Then: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak P_n&lt;/math&gt; is Pappian and &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal Q}&lt;/math&gt; is a ''[[quadric]]'' with index &lt;math&gt;\ge 2&lt;/math&gt;.

==Definition of an oval and an ovoid==
Ovals and ovoids are special quadratic sets:&lt;br /&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak P&lt;/math&gt; be a projective space of dimension &lt;math&gt;\ge 2&lt;/math&gt;. A non-degenerate quadratic set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O&lt;/math&gt; that does not contain lines is called '''ovoid''' (or '''oval''' in plane case).

The following equivalent definition of an oval/ovoid are more common:

'''Definition: (oval)'''
A non-empty point set &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak o&lt;/math&gt; of a projective plane is called 
'''oval''' if the following properties are fulfilled:
:'''(o1)''' Any line meets &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak o&lt;/math&gt; in at most two points.
:('''o2)''' For any point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak o&lt;/math&gt; there is one and only one line &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; such that  &lt;math&gt;g\cap \mathfrak o=\{P\}&lt;/math&gt;.
A line &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;  is a ''exterior'' or ''tangent'' or ''secant'' line of the 
oval if &lt;math&gt;|g\cap \mathfrak o|=0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;|g\cap \mathfrak o|=1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;|g\cap \mathfrak o|=2&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

For ''finite'' planes the following theorem provides a more simple definition.

'''Theorem: (oval in finite plane) '''Let be &lt;math&gt; \mathfrak P&lt;/math&gt; a projective plane of order &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.
A set &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak o&lt;/math&gt; of points is an '''oval''' if &lt;math&gt;|\mathfrak o|=n+1&lt;/math&gt; and if no three points
of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak o&lt;/math&gt; are collinear.

According to this theorem of [[Beniamino Segre]], for ''Pappian'' projective planes of ''odd'' order the ovals are just conics:
 
'''Theorem:'''
Let be &lt;math&gt; \mathfrak P&lt;/math&gt; a ''Pappian'' projective plane of ''odd'' order.
Any oval in &lt;math&gt; \mathfrak P&lt;/math&gt;  is an oval ''conic'' (non-degenerate [[quadric]]).

'''Definition: (ovoid)'''
A non-empty point set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O&lt;/math&gt; of a projective space is called '''ovoid''' if the following properties are fulfilled:
:'''(O1)''' Any line meets &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O&lt;/math&gt; in at most two points.
:(&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is called '''exterior, tangent''' and  '''secant''' line if &lt;math&gt;|g\cap {\mathcal O}|=0, \ |g\cap {\mathcal O}|=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|g\cap {\mathcal O}|=2&lt;/math&gt; respectively.) 
:'''(O2)''' For any point &lt;math&gt;P\in {\mathcal O}&lt;/math&gt; the union &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal O}_P&lt;/math&gt; of all tangent lines through &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a [[hyperplane]] (tangent plane at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;).

'''Example:'''
:a) Any sphere (quadric of index 1) is an ovoid.
:b) In case of real projective spaces one can construct ovoids by combining halves of suitable ellipsoids such that they are no quadrics.

For ''finite'' projective spaces of dimension &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; over a [[Field (algebra)|field]] &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; we have:&lt;br /&gt;
'''Theorem:'''
:a) In case of &lt;math&gt;|K| &lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; an ovoid in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak P_n(K)&lt;/math&gt; exists only if &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;n=3&lt;/math&gt;.
:b) In case of &lt;math&gt;|K| &lt;\infty,\  \operatorname{char} K \ne 2&lt;/math&gt; an ovoid in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak P_n(K)&lt;/math&gt; is a quadric.

Counterexamples (Tits–Suzuki ovoid) show that i.g. statement b) of the theorem above is not true for &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{char} K=2&lt;/math&gt;:

{{About|the geometrical property of an area, termed the second moment of area|the moment of inertia dealing with the rotation of an object with mass|Mass moment of inertia}}
{{For|a list of equations for second moments of area of standard shapes|List of second moments of area}}

The '''2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; moment of area''', or '''second area moment''' and also known as the '''area moment of inertia''', is a geometrical property of an area which reflects how its points are distributed with regard to an arbitrary axis. The second moment of area is typically denoted with either an &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; (for an axis that lies in the plane) or with a &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; (for an axis perpendicular to the plane). In both cases, it is calculated with a [[multiple integral]] over the object in question. Its dimension is L (length) to the fourth power.   Its [[physical unit|unit]] of dimension when working with the [[International System of Units]] is meters to the fourth power, [[metre|m]]&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, or inches to the fourth power, [[inch|in]]&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, when working in the [[Imperial units|Imperial System of Units]].

In [[structural engineering]], the second moment of area of a [[beam (structure)|beam]] is an important property used in the calculation of the beam's [[deflection (engineering)|deflection]] and the calculation of stress caused by a [[Moment (physics)|moment]] applied to the beam. In order to maximize the second moment of area, a large fraction of the cross-sectional area of an I-beam is located at the maximum possible distance from the [[Centroid|centroid]] of the I-beam's cross-section. The '''planar''' second moment of area provides insight into a beam's resistance to bending due to an applied moment, force, or distributed load perpendicular to its neutral axis, as a function of its shape. The [[polar second moment of area]] provides insight into a beam's resistance to torsional deflection, due to an applied moment parallel to its cross-section, as a function of its shape.

: '''''Note:''' Different disciplines use the term ''moment of inertia'' (''MOI'') to refer to different moments. It may refer to either of the '''planar''' second moments of area (often &lt;math&gt; I_x = \textstyle\iint_{R} y^2\, \mathrm{d}A \text{ or } I_y = \textstyle\iint_{R} x^2\, \mathrm{d}A&lt;/math&gt;, with respect to some reference plane), or the '''polar''' second moment of area (&lt;math&gt; I = \textstyle\iint_{R} r^2\, \mathrm{d}A &lt;/math&gt;, where r is the distance to some reference axis).  In each case the integral is over all the infinitesimal elements of ''area'', dA, in some two-dimensional cross-section.  In physics, ''moment of inertia'' is strictly the second moment of '''mass''' with respect to distance from an axis: &lt;math&gt; I = \textstyle\int_{Q} r^2 \mathrm{d}m &lt;/math&gt;, where r is the distance to some potential rotation axis, and the integral is over all the infinitesimal elements of ''mass'', dm, in a three-dimensional space occupied by an object&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|Q}}.  The MOI, in this sense, is the analog of mass for rotational problems. In engineering (especially mechanical and civil), ''moment of inertia'' commonly refers to the second moment of the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beer|first1=Ferdinand P.|title=Vector Mechanics for Engineers|date=2013|place=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-339813-6|edition=10th|page=471|quote=The term second moment is more proper than the term moment of inertia, since, logically, the latter should be used only to denote integrals of mass (see Sec. 9.11). In engineering practice, however, moment of inertia is used in connection with areas as well as masses.}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

==Definition==
[[File:Moment of area of an arbitrary shape.svg|thumb|175px|An arbitrary shape.  ''ρ'' is the radial distance to the element d''A'', with projections ''x'' and ''y'' on the axes.]]

The second moment of area for an arbitrary shape&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|R}} with respect to an arbitrary axis &lt;math&gt;BB'&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

: &lt;math&gt;J_{BB'} = \iint\limits_{R} {\rho}^2 \, \mathrm{d}A&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}A&lt;/math&gt; is the differential area of the arbitrary shape, and
: &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the axis &lt;math&gt;BB'&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pilkey|first1=Walter D.|title=Analysis and Design of Elastic Beams|url=https://archive.org/details/analysisdesignel00pilk|url-access=limited|page=[https://archive.org/details/analysisdesignel00pilk/page/n32 15]|date=2002|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc|isbn=978-0-471-38152-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, when the desired reference axis is the x-axis, the second moment of area &lt;math&gt;I_{xx}&lt;/math&gt; (often denoted as &lt;math&gt;I_x&lt;/math&gt;) can be computed in [[Cartesian coordinates]] as

: &lt;math&gt;I_{x} = \iint\limits_{R} y^2\, \mathrm{d}x\, \mathrm{d}y&lt;/math&gt;

The second moment of the area is crucial in [[Euler–Bernoulli beam equation|Euler–Bernoulli theory]] of slender beams.

=== Product moment of area ===
More generally, the '''product moment of area''' is defined as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beer|first1=Ferdinand P.|title=Vector Mechanics for Engineers|date=2013|place=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-339813-6|edition=10th|page=495|chapter=Chapter 9.8: Product of inertia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;I_{xy} = \iint\limits_{R} yx\, \mathrm{d}x\, \mathrm{d}y&lt;/math&gt;

== Parallel axis theorem ==
[[File:Parallel axis theorem.svg|thumb|175px|A shape with [[Centroid|centroidal]] axis ''x''. The parallel axis theorem can be used to obtain the second moment of area with respect to the ''x''' axis.]]
{{Main article|Parallel axis theorem}}

It is sometimes necessary to calculate the second moment of area of a shape with respect to an &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; axis different to the [[Centroid|centroidal]] axis of the shape. However, it is often easier to derive the second moment of area with respect to its centroidal axis, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and use the parallel axis theorem to derive the second moment of area with respect to the &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; axis. The parallel axis theorem states

: &lt;math&gt;I_{x'} = I_x + A d^2&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the area of the shape, and
: &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the perpendicular distance between the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; axes.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbeler, R. C. (2004). Statics and Mechanics of Materials (Second ed.). Pearson Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-028127-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beer|first1=Ferdinand P.|title=Vector Mechanics for Engineers|date=2013|place=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-339813-6|edition=10th|page=481|chapter=Chapter 9.6: Parallel-axis theorem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar statement can be made about a &lt;math&gt;y'&lt;/math&gt; axis and the parallel centroidal &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; axis. Or, in general, any centroidal &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; axis and a parallel &lt;math&gt;B'&lt;/math&gt; axis.

== Perpendicular axis theorem ==
{{Main article|Perpendicular axis theorem}}
For the simplicity of calculation, it is often desired to define the polar moment of area  (with respect to a perpendicular axis) in terms of two area moments of inertia (both with respect to in-plane axes). The simplest case relates &lt;math&gt;J_z&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;I_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_y&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;J_z = \iint\limits_{R} \rho^2\,\mathrm{d}A = \iint\limits_{R} \left(x^2 + y^2\right)\,\mathrm{d}A = \iint\limits_{R} x^2\,\mathrm{d}A + \iint\limits_{R} y^2\,\mathrm{d}A = I_x + I_y&lt;/math&gt;

This relationship relies on the [[Pythagorean theorem]] which relates &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and on the [[linearity of integration]].

== Composite shapes ==
For more complex areas, it is often easier to divide the area into a series of "simpler" shapes. The second moment of area for the entire shape is the sum of the second moment of areas of all of its parts about a common axis. This can include shapes that are "missing" (i.e. holes, hollow shapes, etc.), in which case the second moment of area of the "missing" areas are subtracted, rather than added. In other words, the second moment of area of "missing" parts are considered negative for the method of composite shapes.

==Examples==
See [[list of second moments of area]] for other shapes.

===Rectangle with centroid at the origin===
[[File:Moment of area of a rectangle through the centroid.svg|thumb|175px|Rectangle with base ''b'' and height ''h'']]
Consider a rectangle with base &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and height &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; whose [[Centroid|centroid]] is located at the origin. &lt;math&gt;I_x&lt;/math&gt; represents the second moment of area with respect to the x-axis; &lt;math&gt;I_y&lt;/math&gt; represents the second moment of area with respect to the y-axis; &lt;math&gt;J_z&lt;/math&gt; represents the polar moment of inertia with respect to the z-axis.

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  I_x &amp;= \iint\limits_{R} y^2\,\mathrm{d}A = \int^\frac{b}{2}_{-\frac{b}{2}} \int^\frac{h}{2}_{-\frac{h}{2}} y^2 \,\mathrm{d}y \,\mathrm{d}x = \int^\frac{b}{2}_{-\frac{b}{2}} \frac{1}{3}\frac{h^3}{4}\,\mathrm{d}x = \frac{b h^3}{12} \\
  I_y &amp;= \iint\limits_{R} x^2\,\mathrm{d}A = \int^\frac{b}{2}_{-\frac{b}{2}} \int^\frac{h}{2}_{-\frac{h}{2}} x^2 \,\mathrm{d}y \,\mathrm{d}x = \int^\frac{b}{2}_{-\frac{b}{2}} h x^2\,\mathrm{d}x = \frac{b^3 h}{12}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[second moment of area#Perpendicular axis theorem|perpendicular axis theorem]] we get the value of &lt;math&gt;J_z&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;J_z = I_x + I_y = \frac{b h^3}{12} + \frac{h b^3}{12} = \frac{b h}{12}\left(b^2 + h^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Annulus centered at origin===
[[File:Moment of area of an annulus.svg|thumb|175px|Annulus with inner radius ''r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and outer radius ''r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'']]

Consider an [[annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] whose center is at the origin, outside radius is &lt;math&gt;r_2&lt;/math&gt;, and inside radius is &lt;math&gt;r_1&lt;/math&gt;. Because of the symmetry of the annulus, the [[Centroid|centroid]] also lies at the origin. We can determine the polar moment of inertia, &lt;math&gt;J_z&lt;/math&gt;, about the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis by the method of composite shapes. This polar moment of inertia is equivalent to the polar moment of inertia of a circle with radius &lt;math&gt;r_2&lt;/math&gt; minus the polar moment of inertia of a circle with radius &lt;math&gt;r_1&lt;/math&gt;, both centered at the origin.  First, let us derive the polar moment of inertia of a circle with radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the origin.  In this case, it is easier to directly calculate &lt;math&gt;J_z&lt;/math&gt; as we already have &lt;math&gt;r^2&lt;/math&gt;, which has both an &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; component.  Instead of obtaining the second moment of area from [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] as done in the previous section, we shall calculate &lt;math&gt;I_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;J_z&lt;/math&gt; directly using [[polar coordinates]].

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  I_{x, circle} &amp;= \iint\limits_{R} y^2\,dA = \iint\limits_{R} (r\sin{\theta)}^2\,\mathrm{d}A = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^r (r\sin{\theta})^2\left(r\,\mathrm{d}r\,\mathrm{d}\theta\right) \\
                &amp;= \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^r r^3\sin^2{\theta}\,\mathrm{d}r\,\mathrm{d}\theta = \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{r^4\sin^2{\theta}}{4}\,\mathrm{d}\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}r^4 \\
  J_{z,circle} &amp;= \iint\limits_{R} r^2\,\mathrm{d}A = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^r r^2\left(r\,\mathrm{d}r\,\mathrm{d}\theta\right) = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^r r^3\,\mathrm{d}r\,\mathrm{d}\theta \\
               &amp;= \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{r^4}{4}\,\mathrm{d}\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}r^4
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, the polar moment of inertia about the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis for an annulus is simply, as stated above, the difference of the second moments of area of a circle with radius &lt;math&gt;r_2&lt;/math&gt; and a circle with radius &lt;math&gt;r_1&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;J_z = J_{z, r_2} - J_{z, r_1} = \frac{\pi}{2}r_2^4 - \frac{\pi}{2}r_1^4 = \frac{\pi}{2}\left(r_2^4 - r_1^4\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, we could change the limits on the &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}r&lt;/math&gt; integral the first time around to reflect the fact that there is a hole.  This would be done like this.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  J_{z} &amp;= \iint\limits_{R} r^2\,\mathrm{d}A = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_{r_1}^{r_2} r^2\left(r\,\mathrm{d}r\,\mathrm{d}\theta\right) = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_{r_1}^{r_2} r^3\,\mathrm{d}r\,\mathrm{d}\theta \\
        &amp;= \int_0^{2\pi}\left[\frac{r_2^4}{4} - \frac{r_1^4}{4}\right]\,\mathrm{d}\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\left(r_2^4 - r_1^4\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Any polygon===

[[File:Moment of area of a polygon.svg|thumb|175px|A simple polygon. Here, &lt;math&gt;n=6&lt;/math&gt;, notice point "7" is identical to point 1. ]]

The second moment of area about the origin for any [[simple polygon]] on the XY-plane can be computed in general by summing contributions from each segment of the polygon after dividing the area into a set of triangles. This formula is related to the [[shoelace formula]] and can be considered a special case of [[Green's theorem]].

A polygon is assumed to have &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices, numbered in counter-clockwise fashion. If polygon vertices are numbered clockwise, returned values will be negative, but absolute values will be correct.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
     I_y &amp;= \frac{1}{12}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i\right) \left( x_i^2 + x_i x_{i+1} + x_{i+1}^2 \right) \\
     I_x &amp;= \frac{1}{12}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i\right)\left( y_i^2 + y_i y_{i+1} + y_{i+1}^2 \right)  \\
  I_{xy} &amp;= \frac{1}{24}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i\right) \left( x_i y_{i+1} + 2 x_i y_i + 2 x_{i+1} y_{i+1} + x_{i+1} y_i \right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

A '''Lénárt sphere''' is a teaching and educational research model for [[spherical geometry]]. The Lénárt sphere is a modern replacement of a "spherical blackboard".&lt;ref name="Brummelen"&gt;{{cite book |first=Glen |last=Van Brummelen |title=Heavenly Mathematics: The Forgotten Art of Spherical Trigonometry  |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-691-14892-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0BCCz8Sx5wkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=van+brummelen&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0SXuULbUFOLo2QXWqYCwDA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA 60-page preview of Van Brummelen], see p. xiii on Lenart (image redacted on Google)&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{See also|History of trigonometry}}

The Lénárt sphere was invented by István Lénárt in Hungary in the early 1990s and its use is described in his 2003 book comparing planar and spherical geometry.&lt;ref name="The Lenart Sphere"&gt;{{citation |first=Istvan |last=Lenart |title=Non-Euclidean Adventures on the Lenart Sphere: Activities Comparing Planar and Spherical Geometry  |publisher=Key Curriculum Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-1559531030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spherical trigonometry]] used to be an important mathematics topic from antiquity through the end of [[World War II]], and has been replaced in modern education and (in navigation) with more algorithmic methods as well as [[GPS]], including the [[Haversine formula]], linear algebraic [[matrix multiplication]], and [[Spherical trigonometry#Napier's Pentagon|Napier's pentagon]]. The Lénárt sphere is still widely used throughout Europe in [[non-Euclidean geometry]] as well as [[GIS]] courses.

== Spherical tessellation ==

The Lénárt sphere is useful in modeling and demonstrating spherical tesselation techniques, especially as they apply to finite analysis problems. Using 3D graphics programs or Python code (see external reference link 8 for open source Python code examples vs. [[NURBS]]), greater and greater numbers of polygons can be projected to and from the sphere both for analysis of finite elements, and synthesis of objects and features on the sphere, such as the asteroid ridden planet in the example. In this case, the Lénárt sphere is useful for tesselation (tiling) as a simplification or approximation shortcut to the extremely complex differential math of finite analysis and construction (technically: modeling), especially of animated objects.&lt;ref name=Mechtley&gt;{{cite book |first=Adam |last=Mechtley |title=Maya Python for Games and Film  |publisher=[[Morgan Kaufmann]] |year=2011 |isbn=978-0123785787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access sequences and competitive ratio==
As typically formulated, the online binary search tree problem involves search trees defined over a fixed key set (1, 2, ..., ''n''). An ''access sequence'' is a sequence &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2,&lt;/math&gt; ... where each number ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is one of the given keys.

Any particular algorithm for maintaining binary search trees (such as the [[splay tree]] algorithm or [[Iacono's working set structure]]) has a ''cost'' for each access sequence that models the amount of time it would take to use the structure to search for each of the keys in the access sequence in turn. The cost of a search is modeled by assuming that the search tree algorithm has a single pointer into a binary search tree, which at the start of each search points to the root of the tree. The algorithm may then perform any sequence of the following operations:
* Move the pointer to its left child.
* Move the pointer to its right child.
* Move the pointer to its parent.
* Perform a single [[tree rotation]] on the pointer and its parent.
The search is required, at some point within this sequence of operations to move the pointer to a node containing the key, and the cost of the search is the number of operations that are performed in the sequence. The total cost cost&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') for algorithm ''A'' on access sequence ''X'' is the sum of the costs of the searches for each successive key in the sequence.

As is standard in [[Competitive analysis (online algorithm)|competitive analysis]], the [[competitive ratio]] of an algorithm ''A'' is defined to be the maximum, over all access sequences, of the ratio of the cost for ''A'' to the best cost that any algorithm could achieve:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_A = \sup_X \frac{\mathrm{cost}_A(X)}{\mathrm{cost}_\mathrm{opt}(X)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[dynamic optimality conjecture]] states that [[splay tree]]s have constant competitive ratio, but this remains unproven. The geometric view of binary search trees provides a different way of understanding the problem that has led to the development of alternative algorithms that could also (conjecturally) have a constant competitive ratio.

==Translation to a geometric point set==
In the geometric view of the online binary search tree problem,
an ''access sequence'' &lt;math&gt;x_1, . . ., x_m&lt;/math&gt; (sequence of searches performed on a binary search tree (BST) with a key set &lt;math&gt;{1,2,...,n}&lt;/math&gt;) is mapped to the set of points &lt;math&gt;{(x_i, i)}&lt;/math&gt;, where X-axis represents key space and Y-axis represents time; to which a set of '''touched''' nodes is added.  By '''touched''' nodes we mean the following. Consider a BST access algorithm with a single pointer to a node in the tree. At the beginning of an access to a given key &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, this pointer is initialized to the root of the tree. Whenever the pointer moves to or is initialized to a node, we say that the node is touched.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

We represent a BST algorithm for a given input sequence by drawing a point for each item that gets touched.

For example, assume the following BST on 4 nodes is given: [[File:StaticBinarySearchTree GeometricalView example.jpg|130px]]
The key set is {1, 2, 3, 4}.

{{multiple image

| footer = 
}}

Let 3, 1, 4, 2 be the access sequence. 
* In the first access, only the node 3 is touched. 
* In the second access, the nodes 3 and 1 are touched. 
* In the third access - 3 and 4 are touched. 
* In the fourth access, touch 3, then 1, and after that 2.

The touches are represented geometrically: If an item ''x'' is touched in the operations for the ''i''th access, then a point (''x'',''i'') is plotted.

== Arborally satisfied point sets ==

[[File:Rectangle spanned by two points example.jpg|thumb|right|Rectangle spanned by two points. This point set is ''not'' arborally satisfied.]]

[[File:Example of arborally satisfied set of points.jpg|thumb|right|This is an example of arborally satisfied set of points.]]

A point set is said to be '''arborally satisfied''' if the following property holds: for any
pair of points that do not both lie on the same horizontal or vertical line, there exists a third point
which lies in the rectangle spanned by the first two points (either inside or on the boundary).

=== Theorem ===
A point set containing the points &lt;math&gt;(x_i, i)&lt;/math&gt; is arborally satisfied if and only if it corresponds to a valid BST for the input sequence &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, . . ., x_m&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Proof ====
First, prove that the point set for any valid BST algorithm is arborally satisfied.
Consider points &lt;math&gt;(x, i)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(y, j)&lt;/math&gt;, where {{mvar|x}} is touched at time {{mvar|i}} and {{mvar|y}} is touched at time {{mvar|j}}. Assume by symmetry that &lt;math&gt;x &lt; y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i &lt; j&lt;/math&gt;. It needs to be shown that there exists a third point in the rectangle
with corners as &lt;math&gt;(x, i)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(y, j)&lt;/math&gt;. Also let &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{LCA}_t(a, b)&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[lowest common ancestor]] of nodes {{mvar|a}}
and {{mvar|b}} right before time {{mvar|t}}. There are a few cases:
* If &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{LCA}_i(x, y) \ne x&lt;/math&gt;, then use the point &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{LCA}_i(x, y), i)&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{LCA}_i(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; must have been touched if {{mvar|x}} was.
* If &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{LCA}_j(x, y) \ne y&lt;/math&gt;, then the point &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{LCA}_j(x, y), j)&lt;/math&gt; can be used.
* If neither of the above two cases hold, then {{mvar|x}} must be an ancestor of {{mvar|y}} right before time {{mvar|i}} and {{mvar|y}} be an ancestor of {{mvar|x}} right before time {{mvar|j}}. Then at some time {{mvar|k}} &lt;math&gt;(i \le k &lt; j)&lt;/math&gt;, {{mvar|y}} must have been rotated above {{mvar|x}}, so the point &lt;math&gt;(y, k)&lt;/math&gt; can be used.

Next, show the other direction: given an arborally satisfied point set, a valid BST corresponding to that point set can be constructed. Organize our BST into a treap which is organized in heap-order by next-touch-time. Note that next-touch-time has ties and is thus not uniquely defined, but this isn’t a problem as long as there is a way to break ties. When time {{mvar|i}} reached, the nodes touched form a connected subtree at the top, by the heap ordering property. Now, assign new next-touch-times for this subtree, and rearrange it into a new local treap.
If a pair of nodes, {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}, straddle the boundary between the touched and untouched part
of the treap, then if {{mvar|y}} is to be touched sooner than {{mvar|x}} then &lt;math&gt;(x, now) \to (y, next - touch(y))&lt;/math&gt; is an unsatisfied rectangle because the leftmost such point would be the right child of {{mvar|x}}, not {{mvar|y}}.

{{clear}}

=== Corollary ===
Finding the best BST execution for the input sequence &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, . . ., x_m&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to finding the minimum cardinality superset of points (that contains the input in geometric representation) that is arborally satisfied. The more general problem of finding the minimum cardinality arborally satisfied superset of a general set of input points (not limited to one input point per {{mvar|y}} coordinate), is known to be [[NP-complete]].&lt;ref name="DHIKP09"/&gt;

== Greedy algorithm ==
The following [[greedy algorithm]] constructs arborally satisfiable sets:
* Sweep the point set with a horizontal line by increasing {{mvar|y}} coordinate. 
* At time {{mvar|i}}, place the minimal number of points at &lt;math&gt;y = i&lt;/math&gt; to make the point set up to &lt;math&gt;y \ge i&lt;/math&gt; arborally satisfied. This minimal set of points is uniquely defined: for any unsatisfied rectangle formed with &lt;math&gt;(x_i, i)&lt;/math&gt; in one corner, add the other corner at &lt;math&gt;y = i&lt;/math&gt;.

The algorithm has been conjectured to be optimal within an additive term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

      <text bytes="16288" xml:space="preserve">The '''Huzita–Justin axioms''' or '''Huzita–Hatori axioms''' are a set of rules related to the [[Mathematics of paper folding|mathematical principles of paper folding]], describing the operations that can be made when folding a piece of paper. The [[Axiom|axioms]] assume that the operations are completed on a plane (i.e. a perfect piece of paper), and that all folds are linear. These are not a minimal set of axioms but rather the complete set of possible single folds.

The first seven axioms were first discovered by French folder and mathematician [[Jacques Justin]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Justin|first=Jacques|date=1986|title=Résolution par le pliage de l'équation du troisième degré et applications géométriques|url=https://mathinfo.unistra.fr/fileadmin/upload/IREM/Publications/L_Ouvert/n042/o_42_9-19.pdf|journal=L'Ouvert - Journal de l'APMEP d'Alsace et de l'IREM de Strasbourg|language=French|volume=42|issue=|pages=9–19|doi=|pmid=|access-date=September 7, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Axioms 1 through 6 were rediscovered by [[Japanese people|Japanese]]-[[Italy|Italian]] mathematician [[Humiaki Huzita]] and reported at ''the First International Conference on Origami in Education and Therapy'' in 1991. Axioms 1 though 5 were rediscovered by Auckly and Cleveland in 1995. Axiom 7 was rediscovered by Koshiro Hatori in 2001; [[Robert J. Lang]] also found axiom 7.

==The seven axioms==
The first 6 axioms are known as Huzita's axioms. Axiom 7 was discovered by Koshiro Hatori. [[Jacques Justin]] and [[Robert J. Lang]] also found axiom 7. The axioms are as follows:

# Given two distinct points ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a unique fold that passes through both of them.

Axiom 5 may have 0, 1, or 2 solutions, while Axiom 6 may have 0, 1, 2, or 3 solutions. In this way, the resulting geometries of origami are stronger than the geometries of [[compass and straightedge]], where the maximum number of solutions an axiom has is 2. Thus compass and straightedge geometry solves second-degree equations, while origami geometry, or origametry, can solve third-degree equations, and solve problems such as [[angle trisection]] and [[doubling of the cube]]. The construction of the fold guaranteed by Axiom 6 requires "sliding" the paper, or [[neusis]], which is not allowed in classical compass and straightedge constructions. Use of neusis together with a compass and straightedge does allow trisection of an arbitrary angle.

==Details==

===Axiom 1===
Given two points ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a unique fold that passes through both of them.

[[Image:Huzita axiom 1.png|Folding a line through two points]]

In parametric form, the equation for the line that passes through the two points is :

:&lt;math&gt;F(s)=p_1 +s(p_2 - p_1).&lt;/math&gt;

===Axiom 2===
Given two points ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a unique fold that places ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Image:Huzita axiom 2.png|Folding a line putting one point on another]]

This is equivalent to finding the perpendicular bisector of the line segment ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This can be done in four steps:

* Use '''Axiom 1''' to find the line through ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, given by &lt;math&gt;P(s)=p_1+s(p_2-p_1)&lt;/math&gt;
* Find the [[midpoint]] of ''p''&lt;sub&gt;mid&lt;/sub&gt; of ''P''(''s'')
* Find the vector '''v'''&lt;sup&gt;perp&lt;/sup&gt; perpendicular to ''P''(''s'')
* The [[parametric equation]] of the fold is then:
:&lt;math&gt;F(s)=p_\mathrm{mid} + s\cdot\mathbf{v}^{\mathrm{perp}}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Axiom 3===
Given two lines ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a fold that places ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Image:Huzita axiom 3.png|Folding a line putting one line on another]]

This is equivalent to finding a bisector of the angle between ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Let ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be any two points on ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and let ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be any two points on ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Also, let '''u''' and '''v''' be the unit direction vectors of ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively; that is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} = (p_2-p_1) / \left|(p_2-p_1)\right|&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = (q_2-q_1) / \left|(q_2-q_1)\right|.&lt;/math&gt;

If the two lines are not parallel, their point of intersection is:

:&lt;math&gt;p_\mathrm{int} = p_1+s_\mathrm{int}\cdot\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;s_{int} = -\frac{\mathbf{v}^{\perp} \cdot (p_1 - q_1)} {\mathbf{v}^{\perp} \cdot \mathbf{u}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The direction of one of the bisectors is then:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w} = \frac{
\left|\mathbf{u}\right| \mathbf{v} +
\left|\mathbf{v}\right| \mathbf{u}}
{\left|\mathbf{u}\right| +
\left|\mathbf{v}\right|}.&lt;/math&gt;

And the parametric equation of the fold is:

:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = p_\mathrm{int} + s\cdot\mathbf{w}.&lt;/math&gt;

A second bisector also exists, perpendicular to the first and passing through ''p''&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt;. Folding along this second bisector will also achieve the desired result of placing ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It may not be possible to perform one or the other of these folds, depending on the location of the intersection point.

If the two lines are parallel, they have no point of intersection. The fold must be the line midway between ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and parallel to them.

===Axiom 4===
Given a point ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and a line ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a unique fold perpendicular to ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; that passes through point ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Image:Huzita axiom 4.png|Folding through a point perpendicular to a line]]

This is equivalent to finding a perpendicular to ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; that passes through ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. If we find some vector '''v''' that is perpendicular to the line ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, then the parametric equation of the fold is:

:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = p_1 + s\cdot\mathbf{v}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Axiom 5===
Given two points ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a line ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a fold that places ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and passes through ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Image:Huzita axiom 5.png|Folding a point onto a line through another point]]

This axiom is equivalent to finding the intersection of a line with a circle, so it may have 0, 1, or 2 solutions. The line is defined by ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and the circle has its center at ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and a radius equal to the distance from ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. If the line does not intersect the circle, there are no solutions. If the line is tangent to the circle, there is one solution, and if the line intersects the circle in two places, there are two solutions.

If we know two points on the line, (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), then the line can be expressed parametrically as:

:&lt;math&gt;x = x_1 + s(x_2 - x_1)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y = y_1 + s(y_2 - y_1).&lt;/math&gt;

Let the circle be defined by its center at ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=(''x&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''y&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''), with radius &lt;math&gt;r = \left|p_1 - p_2\right|&lt;/math&gt;. Then the circle can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;(x-x_c)^2 + (y-y_c)^2 = r^2.&lt;/math&gt;

In order to determine the points of intersection of the line with the circle, we substitute the ''x'' and ''y'' components of the equations for the line into the equation for the circle, giving:

:&lt;math&gt;(x_1 + s(x_2-x_1) - x_c)^2 + (y_1 + s(y_2 - y_1) - y_c)^2 = r^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Or, simplified:

:&lt;math&gt;as^2 + bs + c = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;a = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b = 2(x_2 - x_1)(x_1 - x_c) + 2(y_2 - y_1)(y_1 - y_c)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c = x_c^2 + y_c^2 + x_1^2 + y_1^2 - 2(x_c x_1 + y_c y_1)-r^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Then we simply solve the quadratic equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.&lt;/math&gt;

If the discriminant ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;4''ac'' &amp;lt; 0, there are no solutions. The circle does not intersect or touch the line. If the discriminant is equal to 0, then there is a single solution, where the line is tangent to the circle. And if the discriminant is greater than 0, there are two solutions, representing the two points of intersection. Let us call the solutions ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, if they exist. We have 0, 1, or 2 line segments:

:&lt;math&gt;m_1 = \overline{p_1 d_1} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;m_2 = \overline{p_1 d_2}. &lt;/math&gt;

A fold ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') perpendicular to ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; through its midpoint will place ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; on the line at location ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Similarly, a fold ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') perpendicular to ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through its midpoint will place ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; on the line at location ''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The application of Axiom 2 easily accomplishes this. The parametric equations of the folds are thus:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
F_1(s) &amp; = p_1 +\frac{1}{2}(d_1-p_1)+s(d_1-p_1)^\perp \\[8pt]
F_2(s) &amp; = p_1 +\frac{1}{2}(d_2-p_1)+s(d_2-p_1)^\perp.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Axiom 6===
Given two points ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and two lines ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a fold that places ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Image:Huzita axiom 6.png]]

This axiom is equivalent to finding a line simultaneously tangent to two parabolas, and can be considered equivalent to solving a third-degree equation as there are in general three solutions. The two parabolas have foci at ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, with directrices defined by ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively.

This fold is called the Beloch fold after [[Margherita Piazzola Beloch|Margharita P. Beloch]], who in 1936 showed using it that origami can be used to solve general cubic equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Solving Cubics With Creases: The Work of Beloch and Lill |author=Thomas C. Hull |url=http://mars.wne.edu/~thull/papers/amer.math.monthly.118.04.307-hull.pdf |journal=American Mathematical Monthly |volume=118 |issue=4 |date=April 2011 |pages=307–315|doi=10.4169/amer.math.monthly.118.04.307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Axiom 7===
Given one point ''p'' and two lines ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a fold that places ''p'' onto ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and is perpendicular to ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Image:Huzita-Hatori axiom 7.png]]

This axiom was originally discovered by Jacques Justin in 1989 but was overlooked and was rediscovered by Koshiro Hatori in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=One-, Two-, and Multi-Fold Origami Axioms |url=http://www.math.sjsu.edu/~alperin/AlperinLang.pdf |author1=Roger C. Alperin |author2=Robert J. Lang |journal=4OSME |publisher=A K Peters |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert J. Lang]] has proven that this list of axioms completes the axioms of origami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lang, Robert J. |title=Origami and Geometric Constructions |publisher=Robert J. Lang |year=2010 |url=https://langorigami.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/origami_constructions.pdf |accessdate=2020-09-22 |author-link=Robert J. Lang |pages=40–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constructibility==
Subsets of the axioms  can be used to construct different sets of numbers. The first three can be used with three given points not on a line to do what Alperin calls Thalian constructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Mathematical Theory of Origami Constructions and Numbers |first1=Roger C |last1=Alperin |journal=New York Journal of Mathematics |year=2000 |volume=6 |pages=119–133 |url=http://nyjm.albany.edu/j/2000/6-8.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first four axioms with two given points define a system weaker than [[compass and straightedge constructions]]: every shape that can be folded with those axioms can be constructed with compass and straightedge, but some things can be constructed by compass and straightedge that cannot be folded with those axioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=D. Auckly and J. Cleveland|title=Totally real origami and impossible paperfolding|journal=American Mathematical Monthly|volume=102|issue=3|pages=215–226|arxiv=math/0407174|doi=10.2307/2975008|jstor=2975008|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numbers that can be constructed are called the origami or pythagorean numbers, if the distance between the two given points is 1 then the constructible points are all of the form &lt;math&gt;(\alpha,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are Pythagorean numbers. The Pythagorean numbers are given by the smallest field containing the rational numbers and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1+\alpha^2}&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is such a number.

Adding the fifth axiom gives the [[Euclidean number]]s, that is the points constructible by [[Compass-and-straightedge construction|compass and straightedge construction]].

Adding the [[Neusis construction|neusis]] axiom 6, all compass-straightedge constructions, and more, can be made.  In particular, the [[Constructible polygon|constructible]] regular polygons with these axioms are those with &lt;math&gt;2^a3^b\rho\ge3&lt;/math&gt; sides, where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is a product of distinct [[Pierpont prime]]s.  Compass-straightedge constructions allow only those with  &lt;math&gt;2^a\phi\ge3&lt;/math&gt; sides, where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a product of distinct [[Fermat prime]]s.  (Fermat primes are a [[subset]] of Pierpont primes.)

The seventh axiom does not allow construction of further axioms. The seven axioms give all the single-fold constructions that can be done rather than being a minimal set of axioms.

== An eighth axiom ==
The existence of an eighth axiom was claimed by Lucero in 2017, which may be stated as: there is a fold along a given line ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lucero|first=Jorge C.|date=2017|title=On the Elementary Single-Fold Operations of Origami: Reflections and Incidence Constraints on the Plane|url=http://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2017volume17/FG201725.pdf|journal=Forum Geometricorum|volume=17|pages=207–221|via=|bibcode=2016arXiv161009923L|arxiv=1610.09923}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new axiom was found after enumerating all possible incidences between constructible points and lines on a plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://getd.libs.uga.edu/pdfs/lee_hwa-young_201712_ma.pdf|title=Origami-Constructible Numbers|last=Lee|first=Hwa Y.|publisher=University of Georgia|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=64|type=Master's Thesis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it does not create a new line, it is nevertheless needed in actual paper folding when it is required to fold a layer of paper along a line marked on the layer immediately below.

      <text bytes="3712" xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], the '''Minkowski–Steiner formula''' is a formula relating the [[area|surface area]] and [[volume]] of [[compact space|compact]] [[subset]]s of [[Euclidean space]]. More precisely, it defines the surface area as the "derivative" of enclosed volume in an appropriate sense.

The Minkowski–Steiner formula is used, together with the [[Brunn–Minkowski theorem]], to prove the [[isoperimetric inequality]]. It is named after [[Hermann Minkowski]] and [[Jakob Steiner]].

==Statement of the Minkowski-Steiner formula==

Let &lt;math&gt;n \geq 2&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;A \subsetneq \mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; be a compact set. Let &lt;math&gt;\mu (A)&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[Lebesgue measure]] (volume) of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Define the quantity &lt;math&gt;\lambda (\partial A)&lt;/math&gt; by the '''Minkowski–Steiner formula'''

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda (\partial A) := \liminf_{\delta \to 0} \frac{\mu \left( A + \overline{B_{\delta}} \right) - \mu (A)}{\delta},&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{B_{\delta}} := \left\{ x = (x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}) \in \mathbb{R}^{n} \left| | x | := \sqrt{x_{1}^{2} + \dots + x_{n}^{2}} \leq \delta \right. \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

denotes the [[closed ball]] of [[radius]] &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, and

:&lt;math&gt;A + \overline{B_{\delta}} := \left\{ a + b \in \mathbb{R}^{n} \left| a \in A, b \in \overline{B_{\delta}} \right. \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[Minkowski sum]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{B_{\delta}}&lt;/math&gt;, so that

:&lt;math&gt;A + \overline{B_{\delta}} = \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R}^{n} \mathrel|\ \mathopen| x - a \mathclose| \leq \delta \mbox{ for some } a \in A \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Remarks==

===Surface measure===

For "sufficiently regular" sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, the quantity &lt;math&gt;\lambda (\partial A)&lt;/math&gt; does indeed correspond with the &lt;math&gt;(n - 1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional measure of the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] &lt;math&gt;\partial A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. See Federer (1969) for a full treatment of this problem.

===Convex sets===

When the set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a [[convex set]], the [[limit inferior|lim-inf]] above is a true [[Limit of a sequence|limit]], and one can show that

:&lt;math&gt;\mu \left( A + \overline{B_{\delta}} \right) = \mu (A) + \lambda (\partial A) \delta + \sum_{i = 2}^{n - 1} \lambda_{i} (A) \delta^{i} + \omega_{n} \delta^{n},&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are some [[continuous function]]s of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (see [[quermassintegral]]s) and &lt;math&gt;\omega_{n}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the measure (volume) of the [[unit ball]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{n} = \frac{2 \pi^{n / 2}}{n \Gamma (n / 2)},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Gamma function]].

==Example: volume and surface area of a ball==

Taking &lt;math&gt;A = \overline{B_{R}}&lt;/math&gt; gives the following well-known formula for the surface area of the [[sphere]] of radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_{R} := \partial B_{R}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda (S_{R}) = \lim_{\delta \to 0} \frac{\mu \left( \overline{B_{R}} + \overline{B_{\delta}} \right) - \mu \left( \overline{B_{R}} \right)}{\delta}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= \lim_{\delta \to 0} \frac{[ (R + \delta)^{n} - R^{n} ] \omega_{n}}{\delta}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= n R^{n - 1} \omega_{n},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\omega_{n}&lt;/math&gt; is as above.

Although the adding of auxiliary constructs can often make a problem obvious, it's not at all obvious to discover the helpful construct among all the possibilities, and for this reason many prefer to use more systematic methods for the solution of geometric problems (such as the coordinate method, which requires much less ingenuity).

'''Synthetic geometry''' (sometimes referred to as '''axiomatic geometry''' or even '''pure geometry''') is the study of [[geometry]] [[Coordinate-free|without the use of coordinates]] or [[formula]]e. It relies on the [[axiomatic method]] and the tools directly related to them, that is, [[compass and straightedge]], to draw conclusions and solve problems. 

Only after the introduction of [[coordinate system|coordinate methods]] was there a reason to introduce the term "synthetic geometry" to distinguish this approach to geometry from other approaches.
Other approaches to geometry are embodied in [[analytic geometry|analytic]] and [[algebraic geometry|algebraic]] geometries, where one would use [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[algebra|algebraic techniques]] to obtain geometric results.

According to [[Felix Klein]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Synthetic geometry is that which studies [[shape|figures]] as such, without recourse to formulae, whereas analytic geometry consistently makes use of such formulae as can be written down after the adoption of an appropriate system of coordinates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Klein|1948|loc=p. 55}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Geometry as presented by [[Euclid]] in [[Euclid's  Elements |the ''Elements'']] is the quintessential example of the use of the synthetic method. It was the favoured method of [[Isaac Newton]] for the solution of geometric problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyer|2004|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Synthetic methods were most prominent during the 19th century when geometers rejected coordinate methods in establishing the [[foundations of geometry|foundations]] of [[projective geometry]] and [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]]. For example the [[geometer]] [[Jakob Steiner]] (1796 – 1863) hated analytic geometry, and always gave preference to synthetic methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Printonly/Steiner.html |title=Steiner (print-only) |publisher=History.mcs.st-and.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logical synthesis==
The process of logical synthesis begins with some arbitrary but definite starting point. This starting point is the introduction of primitive notions or primitives and axioms about these primitives:
* '''[[Primitive notion|Primitives]]''' are the most basic ideas. Typically they include both objects and relationships. In geometry, the objects are things such as ''points'', ''lines'' and ''planes'', while a fundamental relationship is that of ''incidence'' – of one object meeting or joining with another. The terms themselves are undefined. [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] once remarked that instead of points, lines and planes one might just as well talk of tables, chairs and beer mugs,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|1974|loc=p. 59}}&lt;/ref&gt; the point being that the primitive terms are just empty [[Free variables and bound variables|placeholders]] and have no intrinsic properties.
* '''[[Axiom]]s''' are statements about these primitives; for example, ''any two points are together incident with just one line'' (i.e. that for any two points, there is just one line which passes through both of them). Axioms are assumed true, and not proven. They are  the ''building blocks'' of geometric concepts, since they specify the properties that the primitives have.

From a given set of axioms, synthesis proceeds as a carefully constructed logical argument. When a significant result is proved rigorously, it becomes a '''[[theorem]]'''.

===Properties of axiom sets===
There is no fixed axiom set for geometry, as more than one [[consistency |consistent set]] can be chosen. Each such set may lead to a different geometry, while there are also examples of different sets giving the same geometry. With this plethora of possibilities, it is no longer appropriate to speak of "geometry" in the singular.

Historically, Euclid's [[parallel postulate]] has turned out to be [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] of the other axioms. Simply discarding it gives [[absolute geometry]], while negating it yields [[hyperbolic geometry]].&lt;!-- note in absolute geometry non intersecting lines and infinite long lines exists--&gt; Other [[consistency |consistent axiom sets]] can yield other geometries, such as [[projective geometry|projective]], [[elliptic geometry|elliptic]], [[spherical geometry|spherical]] or [[affine geometry|affine]] geometry.

Axioms of continuity and "betweeness" are also optional, for example, [[discrete geometry|discrete geometries]] may be created by discarding or modifying them.

Following the [[Erlangen program]] of [[Felix Klein|Klein]], the nature of any given geometry can be seen as the connection between [[symmetry]] and the content of the propositions, rather than the style of development.

==History==
Euclid's original treatment remained unchallenged for over two thousand years, until the simultaneous discoveries of the non-Euclidean geometries by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], [[János Bolyai|Bolyai]], [[Nikolai Lobachevsky|Lobachevsky]] and [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]] in the 19th century led mathematicians to question Euclid's underlying assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;Mlodinow 2001, Part III The Story of Gauss&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- see also [[Bernhard Riemann#Riemannian geometry]] --&gt;

One of the early French analysts summarized synthetic geometry this way:
:''The Elements'' of Euclid are treated by the synthetic method. This author, after having posed the ''axioms'', and formed the requisites, established the propositions which he proves successively being supported by that which preceded, proceeding always from the ''simple to compound'', which is the essential character of synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;[[S. F. Lacroix]] (1816) ''Essais sur L'Enseignement en Général, et sur celui des Mathématiques en Particulier'', page 207, Libraire pur les Mathématiques.&lt;/ref&gt;

The heyday of synthetic geometry can be considered to have been the 19th century, when analytic methods based on [[Coordinate system|coordinates]] and [[calculus]] were ignored by some [[list of geometers|geometers]] such as [[Jakob Steiner]], in favor of a purely synthetic development of  [[projective geometry]]. For example, the treatment of the [[projective plane]] starting from axioms of incidence is actually a broader theory (with more [[model theory|models]]) than is found by starting with a [[vector space]] of dimension three. Projective geometry has in fact the simplest and most elegant synthetic expression of any geometry.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

In his [[Erlangen program]], [[Felix Klein]] played down the tension between synthetic and analytic methods:
::On the Antithesis between the Synthetic and the Analytic Method in Modern Geometry:
:The distinction between modern synthesis and modern analytic geometry must no longer be regarded as essential, inasmuch as both subject-matter and methods of reasoning have gradually taken a similar form in both. We choose therefore in the text as common designation of them both the term projective geometry. Although the synthetic method has more to do with space-perception and thereby imparts a rare charm to its first simple developments, the realm of space-perception is nevertheless not closed to the analytic method, and the formulae of analytic geometry can be looked upon as a precise and perspicuous statement of geometrical relations. On the other hand, the advantage to original research of a well formulated analysis should not be underestimated, - an advantage due to its moving, so to speak, in advance of the thought. But it should always be insisted that a mathematical subject is not to be considered exhausted until it has become intuitively evident, and the progress made by the aid of analysis is only a first, though a very important, step.&lt;ref&gt;Felix Klein (1872) Ralf Stephan translator (2006) [https://arxiv.org/abs/0807.3161 "A comparative review of researches in geometry"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The close axiomatic study of [[Euclidean geometry]] led to the construction of the [[Lambert quadrilateral]] and the [[Saccheri quadrilateral]]. These structures introduced the field of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] where Euclid's parallel axiom is denied. [[Gauss]], [[Bolyai]] and [[Lobachevski]] independently constructed [[hyperbolic geometry]], where parallel lines have an [[angle of parallelism]] that depends on their separation. This study became widely accessible through the [[Poincaré disc]] model where [[motion (geometry)|motion]]s are given by [[Möbius transformation]]s. Similarly, [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]], a student of Gauss's, constructed [[Riemannian geometry]], of which [[elliptic geometry]] is a particular case.

Another example concerns [[inversive geometry]] as advanced by [[Ludwig Immanuel Magnus]], which can be considered synthetic in spirit. The closely related operation of [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocation]] expresses analysis of the plane.

[[Karl von Staudt]] showed that algebraic axioms, such as [[commutativity]] and [[associativity]] of addition and multiplication, were in fact consequences of [[incidence (geometry)|incidence]] of lines in [[geometric configuration]]s. [[David Hilbert]] showed&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hilbert]], 1980 (1899). ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17384/17384-pdf.pdf The Foundations of Geometry]'', 2nd edition, §22 Desargues Theorem, Chicago: Open Court&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Desargues configuration]] played a special role. Further work was done by [[Ruth Moufang]] and her students. The concepts have been one of the motivators of [[incidence geometry]].

When [[parallel lines]] are taken as primary, synthesis produces [[affine geometry]]. Though Euclidean geometry is both an affine and [[metric geometry]], in general [[affine space]]s may be missing a metric. The extra flexibility thus afforded makes affine geometry appropriate for the study of [[spacetime]], as discussed in the [[affine geometry#History|history of affine geometry]].

In 1955 Herbert Busemann and Paul J. Kelley sounded a nostalgic note for synthetic geometry:
:Although reluctantly, geometers must admit that the beauty of synthetic geometry has lost its appeal for the new generation. The reasons are clear: not so long ago synthetic geometry was the only field in which the reasoning proceeded strictly from axioms, whereas this appeal — so fundamental to many mathematically interested people — is now made by many other fields.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Busemann]] and Paul J. Kelly (1953) ''Projective Geometry and Projective Metrics'', Preface, page v, [[Academic Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, college studies now include [[linear algebra]], [[topology]], and [[graph theory]] where the subject is developed from first principles, and propositions are deduced by [[elementary proof]]s.

Today's student of geometry has axioms other than Euclid's available: see [[Hilbert's axioms]] and [[Tarski's axioms]].

[[Ernst Kötter]] published a (German) report in 1901 on ''"The development of synthetic geometry from [[Monge]] to Staudt (1847)"'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Ernst Kötter| title=Die Entwickelung der Synthetischen Geometrie von Monge bis auf Staudt (1847)| year=1901 |url=http://gdz-lucene.tc.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gcs/gcs?&amp;action=pdf&amp;metsFile=PPN37721857X_0005&amp;divID=LOG_0035&amp;pagesize=original&amp;pdfTitlePage=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/pdftitle/?metsFile=PPN37721857X_0005%7C&amp;targetFileName=PPN37721857X_0005_LOG_0035.pdf&amp;}} (2012 Reprint as {{ISBN|1275932649}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proofs using synthetic geometry==

Synthetic proofs of geometric theorems make use of auxiliary constructs (such as [[Auxiliary line|helping lines]]) and concepts such as equality of sides or angles and [[similarity (geometry)|similarity]] and [[congruence (geometry)|congruence]] of triangles. Examples of such proofs can be found in the articles [[Butterfly theorem]], [[Angle bisector theorem]], [[Apollonius' theorem]], [[British flag theorem]], [[Ceva's theorem]], [[Equal incircles theorem]], [[Geometric mean theorem]], [[Heron's formula]], [[Isosceles triangle theorem]], [[Law of cosines]], and others that are linked to [[:Category:Theorems in plane geometry|here]].

==Computational synthetic geometry==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2019}}
In conjunction with [[computational geometry]], a '''computational synthetic geometry''' has been founded, having close connection, for example, with [[matroid]] theory. [[Synthetic differential geometry]] is an application of [[topos]] theory to the foundations of [[differentiable manifold]] theory.

[[File:Amplituhedron-0c.png|thumb|Notional amplituhedron visualization.]]
In [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical physics]] (especially [[twistor string theory]]), an '''amplituhedron''' is a geometric structure introduced in 2013 by [[Nima Arkani-Hamed]] and Jaroslav Trnka. It enables simplified calculation of [[particle]] interactions in some [[quantum field]] theories. In [[Planar Yang–Mills theory|planar ''N'' = 4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory]], also equivalent to the perturbative [[Topological string theory#B-model|topological B model string theory]] in [[twistor space]], an amplituhedron is defined as a mathematical space known as the positive [[Grassmannian]].&lt;ref name="Arkani-Hamed Trnka 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Arkani-Hamed |first1=Nima |last2=Trnka |first2=Jaroslav |year=2014 |title=The Amplituhedron |journal=[[Journal of High Energy Physics]] |volume=2014 |issue=10 |pages=30 |doi=10.1007/JHEP10(2014)030 |arxiv=1312.2007 |ref=harv |bibcode = 2014JHEP...10..030A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Witten"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Witten|first=Edward|title=Perturbative Gauge Theory As A String Theory In Twistor Space:|journal=Communications in Mathematical Physics|date=December 2003|volume=252|series=1|issue=1|page=189|doi=10.1007/s00220-004-1187-3|arxiv=hep-th/0312171|bibcode = 2004CMaPh.252..189W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amplituhedron theory challenges the notion that [[spacetime]] [[principle of locality|locality]] and [[unitarity (physics)|unitarity]] are necessary components of a model of particle interactions. Instead, they are treated as properties that emerge from an underlying phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Arkani-Hamed Bourjaily Cachazo Goncharov 2012"&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1212.5605|first1=Nima|last1=Arkani-Hamed|last2=Bourjaily|first2=Jacob L.|first3=Freddy|last3=Cachazo|last4=Goncharov|first4=Alexander B.|first5=Alexander|last5=Postnikov|first6=Jaroslav|last6=Trnka|title=Scattering Amplitudes and the Positive Grassmannian|class=hep-th|date=2012|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ohanlon20130919&gt;{{cite web|url=https://psmag.com/how-to-feel-about-space-and-time-maybe-not-existing-76578241dca2|title=How to Feel About Space and Time Maybe Not Existing|publisher=Pacific Standard|author= Ryan O'Hanlon | date=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The connection between the amplituhedron and scattering amplitudes is at present{{when|date=July 2019}} a conjecture that has passed many non-trivial checks, including an understanding of how locality and unitarity arise as consequences of positivity.&lt;ref name="Arkani-Hamed Trnka 2014" /&gt; Research has been led by [[Nima Arkani-Hamed]]. [[Edward Witten]] described the work as "very unexpected" and said that "it is difficult to guess what will happen or what the lessons will turn out to be".&lt;ref name="Quandra20130917"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-discover-geometry-underlying-particle-physics-20130917/|title=A Jewel at the Heart of Quantum Physics|author=[[Natalie Wolchover]]|work=[[Quanta Magazine]]|date=September 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
When [[subatomic particle]]s interact, different outcomes are possible. The evolution of the various possibilities is called a "tree" and the probability of a given outcome is called its [[scattering amplitude]]. According to the principle of [[unitarity (physics)|unitarity]], the sum of the probabilities for every possible outcome is 1.

The [[On shell and off shell|on-shell]] scattering process "tree" may be described by a positive [[Grassmannian]], a structure in [[algebraic geometry]] analogous to a [[convex polytope]], that generalizes the idea of a [[simplex]] in [[projective space]].&lt;ref name="Arkani-Hamed Bourjaily Cachazo Goncharov 2012" /&gt; A [[polytope]] is the ''n''-dimensional analogue of a 3-dimensional [[polyhedron]], the values being calculated in this case are scattering amplitudes, and so the object is called an ''amplituhedron''.&lt;ref name="Arkani-Hamed Trnka 2014" /&gt;

Using [[twistor theory]], [[BCFW recursion]] relations involved in the scattering process may be represented as a small number of twistor diagrams. These diagrams effectively provide the recipe for constructing the positive Grassmannian, i.e. the amplituhedron, which may be captured in a single equation.&lt;ref name="Arkani-Hamed Bourjaily Cachazo Goncharov 2012" /&gt; The scattering amplitude can thus be thought of as the volume of a certain polytope, the positive Grassmannian, in momentum twistor space.&lt;ref name="Arkani-Hamed Trnka 2014" /&gt;

When the volume of the amplituhedron is calculated in the [[1/N expansion|planar limit]] of  [[N = 4 super Yang–Mills|''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 ''D''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory]], it describes the [[scattering amplitude]]s of [[subatomic particles]].&lt;ref name="Arkani-Hamed Trnka 2014" /&gt; The amplituhedron thus provides a more intuitive geometric model for calculations with highly-abstract underlying principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Amplituhedron and Other Excellently Silly Words |work=4 gravitons and a grad student |date=September 20, 2013 |url=https://4gravitonsandagradstudent.wordpress.com/2013/09/20/the-amplituhedron-and-other-excellently-silly-words/ |archivedate=September 25, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925062845/https://4gravitonsandagradstudent.wordpress.com/2013/09/20/the-amplituhedron-and-other-excellently-silly-words/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The twistor-based representation provides a recipe for constructing specific cells in the Grassmannian which assemble to form a positive Grassmannian, i.e. the representation describes a specific [[cellular decomposition|cell decomposition]] of the positive Grassmannian.

The recursion relations can be resolved in many different ways, each giving rise to a different representation, with the final amplitude expressed as a sum of on-shell processes in different ways as well. Therefore, any given on-shell representation of scattering amplitudes is not unique, but all such representations of a given interaction yield the same amplituhedron.&lt;ref name="Arkani-Hamed Trnka 2014" /&gt;

The twistor approach is relatively abstract. While amplituhedron theory provides an underlying geometric model, the geometrical space is not physical spacetime and is also best understood as abstract.&lt;ref name="ananth2017"&gt;Anil Ananthaswamy; "The New Shape of Reality", ''New Scientist'', 29 July 2017, pages 28-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==

The twistor approach simplifies calculations of particle interactions. In a conventional [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbative]] approach to quantum field theory, such interactions may require the calculation of thousands of [[Feynman diagrams]], most describing off-shell "virtual" particles which have no directly observable existence.  In contrast, [[twistor theory]] provides an approach in which scattering amplitudes can be computed in a way that yields much simpler expressions.&lt;ref name=drum20130918&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/09/space-time-illusion-amplituhedron|title=Maybe Space-Time Is Just an Illusion|author=Kevin Drum|publisher=Mother Jones|date=September 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amplituhedron theory calculates scattering amplitudes without referring to such virtual particles. This undermines the case for even a transient, unobservable existence for such virtual particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=GraduatePhysics|title=Nima Arkani-Hamed - Physics and Mathematics for the End of Spacetime|date=2016-07-23|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1-QDXReDTU|accessdate=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ananth2017"/&gt;

The geometric nature of the theory suggests in turn that the nature of the universe, in both classical [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] [[spacetime]] and [[quantum mechanics]], may be described with [[geometry]].&lt;ref name="ananth2017"/&gt;

Calculations can be done without assuming the quantum mechanical properties of [[Principle of locality|locality]] and [[Unitarity (physics)|unitarity]]. In amplituhedron theory, locality and unitarity arise as a direct consequence of positivity.{{clarify|reason=what is positivity in this context?|date=April 2017}} They are encoded in the positive geometry of the amplituhedron, via the singularity structure of the integrand for scattering amplitudes.&lt;ref name="Arkani-Hamed Trnka 2014" /&gt; Arkani-Hamed suggests this is why amplituhedron theory simplifies scattering-amplitude calculations: in the Feynman-diagrams approach, locality is manifest, whereas in the amplituhedron approach, it is implicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Musser |first=George |year=2015 |title=Spooky Action at a Distance |url=https://archive.org/details/spookyactionatdi0000muss |url-access=registration |pages=[https://archive.org/details/spookyactionatdi0000muss/page/40 40–41] |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |location=New York |isbn=978-0-374-53661-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{redirect-distinguish|Triangle postulate|Triangle inequality}}
In a [[Euclidean space]], the '''[[summation|sum]] of angles of a triangle''' equals the [[straight angle]] (180 [[degree (angle)|degrees]], [[pi|{{Pi}}]] [[radians]], two [[right angle]]s, or a half-[[turn (geometry)|turn]]).
A [[triangle]] has three angles, one at each [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]], bounded by a pair of adjacent [[Edge (geometry)|sides]].

It was unknown for a long time whether other geometries exist, for which this sum is different. The influence of this problem on mathematics was particularly strong during the 19th century. Ultimately, the answer was proven to be positive: in other spaces (geometries) this sum can be greater or lesser, but it then must depend on the triangle. Its difference from 180° is a case of ''[[angular defect]]'' and serves as an important distinction for geometric systems.

==Cases==
===Euclidean geometry===
In [[Euclidean geometry]], the '''triangle postulate''' states that the sum of the angles of a triangle is two [[right angle]]s. This postulate is equivalent to the [[parallel postulate]].&lt;ref name=Parallel&gt;
{{Cite book|title=CRC concise encyclopedia of mathematics |author= Eric W. Weisstein |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aFDWuZZslUUC&amp;pg=PA2147 |page=2147 |quote=The parallel postulate is equivalent to the ''Equidistance postulate'', ''Playfair axiom'', ''Proclus axiom'', the ''Triangle postulate'' and the ''Pythagorean theorem''. |edition=2nd |isbn=1-58488-347-2 |year=2003}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In the presence of the other axioms of Euclidean geometry, the following statements are equivalent:&lt;ref name=Devlin&gt;
{{Cite book|title=The Language of Mathematics: Making the Invisible Visible |author=Keith J. Devlin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pT0mlWWgpzQC&amp;pg=PA161 |page=161 |isbn=0-8050-7254-3 |year=2000 |publisher=Macmillan}}

&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Triangle postulate''': The sum of the angles of a triangle is two right angles.
*[[Playfair's axiom]]: Given a straight line and a point not on the line, exactly one straight line may be drawn through the point parallel to the given line.
*[[Proclus' axiom]]: If a line intersects one of two parallel lines, it must intersect the other also.&lt;ref&gt;Essentially, the [[transitive relation|transitivity]] of parallelism.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Equidistance postulate''': Parallel lines are everywhere equidistant (i.e. the [[distance]] from each point on one line to the other line is always the same.)
*'''Triangle area property''': The [[area]] of a triangle can be as large as we please.
*'''Three points property''': Three points either lie on a line or lie on a [[circle]].
*[[Pythagoras' theorem]]: In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides.&lt;ref name="Parallel"/&gt; &lt;!--Removed second reference as per comments of author, see talk page--&gt;

===Hyperbolic geometry===
{{main|Hyperbolic triangle}}
The sum of the angles of a hyperbolic triangle is less than 180°. The relation between angular defect and the triangle's area was first proven by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Foundations of Hyperbolic Manifolds|volume=149|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|first=John|last=Ratcliffe|publisher=Springer|year=2006|isbn=9780387331973|page=99|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JV9m8o-ok6YC&amp;pg=PA99|quotation=That the area of a hyperbolic triangle is proportional to its angle defect first appeared in Lambert's monograph ''Theorie der Parallellinien'', which was published posthumously in 1786.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One can easily see how [[hyperbolic geometry]] breaks Playfair's axiom, Proclus' axiom (the parallelism, defined as non-intersection, is intransitive in an hyperbolic plane), the equidistance postulate (the points on one side of, and equidistant from, a given line do not form a line), and Pythagoras' theorem. A circle&lt;ref&gt;Defined as the set of points at the fixed [[distance]] from its centre.&lt;/ref&gt; cannot have arbitrarily small [[curvature]],&lt;ref&gt;Defined in the differentially-geometrical sense.&lt;/ref&gt; so the three points property also fails.

The sum of the angles can be arbitrarily small (but positive). For an [[ideal triangle]], a generalization of hyperbolic triangles, this sum is equal to zero.

===Spherical geometry===

{{See also|Triangle#Non-planar triangles}}

For a [[spherical triangle]], the sum of the angles is greater than 180° and can be up to 540°. Specifically, the sum of the angles is

:180° × (1 + 4''f'' ),

where ''f'' is the fraction of the sphere's area which is enclosed by the triangle. 

Note that spherical geometry does not satisfy several of [[Euclid's axioms]] (including the [[parallel postulate]].)

==Exterior angles==
[[Image:Triangle somme des angles.png|thumb|right|133px|The picture shows exterior angles along with interior ones, for the rightmost vertex it is shown as {{nowrap|1=&lt;span style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:0.5ex; font-size:85%; color:#0000FF"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:-0.5ex; font-size:85%; color:#009900; text-decoration:line-through"&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;}}]]
{{main|Internal and external angle}}
Angles between adjacent sides of a triangle&lt;!-- can be defined unambiguously and--&gt; are referred to as ''interior'' angles in Euclidean and other geometries. ''Exterior'' angles can be also defined, and the Euclidean triangle postulate can be formulated as the [[exterior angle theorem]]. One can also consider the sum of all three exterior angles, that equals to 360°&lt;ref&gt;From the definition of an exterior angle, its sums up to the straight angle with the interior angles. So, the sum of three exterior angles added to the sum of three interior angles always gives three straight angles.&lt;/ref&gt; in the Euclidean case (as for any [[convex polygon]]), is less than 360° in the spherical case, and is greater than 360° in the hyperbolic case.

==In differential geometry==
In the [[differential geometry of surfaces]], the question of a triangle's angular defect is understood as a special case of the [[Gauss-Bonnet theorem]] where the curvature of a [[closed curve]] is not a function, but a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] with the [[support (mathematics)|support]] in exactly three points – vertices of a triangle.

      <text bytes="5253" xml:space="preserve">In [[geometric measure theory]] an '''approximate tangent space''' is a [[measure theory|measure theoretic]] generalization of the concept of a [[tangent space]] for a [[differentiable manifold]].

== Definition ==

In [[differential geometry]] the defining characteristic of a [[tangent space]] is that it approximates the smooth [[manifold]] to first order near the point of tangency. Equivalently, if we zoom in more and more at the point of tangency the manifold appears to become more and more straight, asymptotically tending to approach the tangent space. This turns out to be the correct point of view in geometric measure theory.

=== Definition for sets ===

'''Definition'''. Let &lt;math&gt;M \subset \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; be a set that is [[measurable]] with respect to ''m''-dimensional [[Hausdorff measure]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}^m&lt;/math&gt;, and such that the restriction measure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}^m \llcorner M&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Radon measure]]. We say that an ''m''-dimensional subspace &lt;math&gt;P \subset \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is the '''approximate tangent space''' to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; at a certain point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;T_x M = P&lt;/math&gt;, if

:&lt;math&gt; \left( \mathcal{H}^m \llcorner M \right)_{x,\lambda} \rightharpoonup \mathcal{H}^m \llcorner P&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\lambda \downarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;

in the sense of [[Radon measure]]s. Here for any measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; we denote by &lt;math&gt;\mu_{x,\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; the rescaled and translated measure:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{x,\lambda}(A) := \lambda^{-n} \mu(x + \lambda A), \qquad A \subset \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;

Certainly any classical tangent space to a smooth submanifold is an approximate tangent space, but the converse is not necessarily true.

=== Multiplicities ===

The parabola

:&lt;math&gt;M_1 := \{ (x, x^2) : x \in \mathbb{R} \} \subset \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;

is a smooth 1-dimensional submanifold. Its tangent space at the origin &lt;math&gt;(0,0) \in M_1&lt;/math&gt; is the horizontal line &lt;math&gt;T_{(0,0)} M_1 = \mathbb{R} \times \{0\}&lt;/math&gt;. On the other hand, if we incorporate the reflection along the ''x''-axis:

:&lt;math&gt;M_2 := \{ (x, x^2) : x \in \mathbb{R} \} \cup \{ (x, -x^2) : x \in \mathbb{R} \} \subset \mathbb{R}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

then &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; is no longer a smooth 1-dimensional submanifold, and there is no classical tangent space at the origin. On the other hand, by zooming in at the origin the set &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; is approximately equal to two straight lines that overlap in the limit. It would be reasonable to say it has an approximate tangent space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R} \times \{0\}&lt;/math&gt; with multiplicity two.

=== Definition for measures ===

One can generalize the previous definition and proceed to define approximate tangent spaces for certain [[Radon measure]]s, allowing for multiplicities as explained in the section above.

'''Definition'''. Let &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; be a Radon measure on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. We say that an ''m''-dimensional subspace &lt;math&gt;P \subset \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is the approximate tangent space to &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; at a point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with multiplicity &lt;math&gt;\theta(x) \in (0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;T_x \mu = P&lt;/math&gt; with multiplicity &lt;math&gt;\theta(x)&lt;/math&gt;, if

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{x,\lambda} \rightharpoonup \theta \; \mathcal{H}^m \llcorner P&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\lambda \downarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;

in the sense of Radon measures. The right-hand side is a constant multiple of ''m''-dimensional [[Hausdorff measure]] restricted to &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

This definition generalizes the one for sets as one can see by taking &lt;math&gt;\mu := \mathcal{H}^n \llcorner M&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; as in that section. It also accounts for the reflected paraboloid example above because for &lt;math&gt;\mu := \mathcal{H}^1 \llcorner M_2&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;T_{(0,0)} \mu = \mathbb{R} \times \{0\}&lt;/math&gt; with multiplicity two.

== Relation to rectifiable sets ==

The notion of approximate tangent spaces is very closely related to that of [[rectifiable set]]s. Loosely speaking, rectifiable sets are precisely those for which approximate tangent spaces exist almost everywhere. The following lemma encapsulates this relationship:

'''Lemma'''. Let &lt;math&gt;M \subset \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; be [[measurable]] with respect to ''m''-dimensional [[Hausdorff measure]]. Then &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is m-[[rectifiable set|rectifiable]] if and only if there exists a positive locally &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}^m&lt;/math&gt;-integrable function &lt;math&gt;\theta : M \to (0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; such that the [[Radon measure]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mu(A) = \int_A \theta(x) \, d\mathcal{H}^m(x) &lt;/math&gt;

has approximate tangent spaces &lt;math&gt;T_x \mu&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}^m&lt;/math&gt;-almost every &lt;math&gt;x \in M&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text bytes="14675" xml:space="preserve">A '''geometric separator''' is a line (or other shape) that partitions a collection of geometric shapes into two subsets, such that proportion of shapes in each subset is bounded, and the number of shapes that do not belong to any subset (i.e. the shapes intersected by the separator itself) is small.

When a geometric separator exists, it can be used for building divide-and-conquer algorithms for solving various problems in [[computational geometry]].

== Separators that are closed shapes ==

A simple case in which a separator is guaranteed to exist is the following:&lt;ref name=SmithWormald1998&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Smith | first1 = W. D. | last2 = Wormald | first2 = N.

:: Given a set of ''n'' disjoint axis-parallel squares in the plane, there is a rectangle ''R'' such that, at most 2''n''/3 of the squares are inside ''R'', at most 2''n''/3 of the squares are outside ''R'', and at most O(sqrt(''n'')) of the squares are not inside and not outside ''R'' (i.e. intersect the boundary of ''R'').

Thus, ''R'' is a geometric separator that separates the ''n'' squares into two subset ("inside ''R''" and "outside ''R''"), with a relatively small "loss" (the squares intersected by R are considered "lost" because they do not belong to any of the two subsets).

=== Proof ===
Define a ''2-fat rectangle'' as an axis-parallel rectangle with an aspect ratio of at most&amp;nbsp;2.

Let ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; be a minimal-area 2-fat rectangle that contains the centers of at least ''n''/3 squares. Thus every 2-fat rectangle smaller than ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; contains fewer than ''n''/3 squares.

For every ''t'' in [0,1), let ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; be a 2-fat rectangle with the same center as ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, inflated by&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''t''.
* ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; contains ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, so it contains the centers of at least ''n''/3 squares.
* ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is less than twice as large as ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, so it can be covered by two 2-fat rectangles that are smaller than ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Each of these 2-fat rectangles contains the centers of less than ''n''/3 squares. Therefore ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; contains the centers of less than 2''n''/3 squares.

Now it remains to show that there is a ''t'' for which ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; intersects at most O(sqrt(''n'')) squares.

First, consider all the "large squares" – the squares whose side-length is at least &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{width}(R_0) / 2 \sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;. For every ''t'', the perimeter of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is at most 2&amp;middot;perimeter(''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) which is at most 6&amp;middot;width(''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), so it can intersect at most &lt;math&gt;12 \sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt; large squares.

Next, consider all the "small squares" – the squares whose side-length is less than &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{width}(R_0) / 2 \sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;.

For every ''t'', define: intersect(''t'') as the set of small squares intersected by the boundary of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;. For every ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;|t_1-t_2| \geq 1/\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;|\operatorname{width}(R_{t_1})-\operatorname{width}(R_{t_2})| \geq \operatorname{width}(R_0)/\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore there is a gap of at least &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{width}(R_0) / 2 \sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt; between the boundary of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and the boundary of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;. Therefore, intersect(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and intersect(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are disjoint. Therefore:

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=0}^{\sqrt{n}-1}{|\operatorname{intersect}(j/\sqrt{n})|} \leq n&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore by the [[pigeonhole principle]] there is a certain ''j''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; for which:

: &lt;math&gt;|\operatorname{intersect}(j_0/\sqrt{n})| \leq \sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;

The separator we look for is the rectangle ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;t = j_0/\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;This proof is based on the more general proof of Chan (2003), but with the better constants of Smith&amp;Wormald (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application example ===
Using this separator theorem, we can solve certain problems in computational geometry in the following way:

* Separate the input set of squares to two disjoint subsets;
* Solve the problem on each subset separately;
* Combine the solutions to the two sub-problems and get an approximate solution to the original problem.

=== Generalizations ===
The above theorem can be generalized in many different ways, with possibly different constants. For example:

* Instead of squares, the input collection can contain arbitrary [[fat object (geometry)|fat object]]s, such as: circles, rectangles with a bounded aspect ratio, etc.
* Instead of two-dimensional shapes in a plane, the input collection can contain objects of any dimension, and they can be situated in a ''d''-dimensional [[torus]].
* Instead of requiring that the shapes in the input collection be disjoint, we can put a weaker requirement, that the collection is:&lt;ref name=SmithWormald1998 /&gt;
** ''k-thick'', i.e., each point is covered by at most ''k'' different shapes.
** ''l-k-thick'', i.e., each point is covered by at most ''k'' different shapes with a size ratio (size of largest shape divided by size of smallest shape) at most&amp;nbsp;''l''.
** ''k-overloaded'', i.e., for any subcollection of shapes, the sum of their individual measures is at most ''k'' times the measure of their union.
* Instead of a rectangle separator, the separator can be any shape that can be covered by smaller copies of itself.
* Instead of bounding the number of shapes in each side of the separator, it is possible to bound any measure which satisfies certain axioms.&lt;ref name=Chan2003 /&gt;

=== Optimality ===
The ratio of 1:2, in the square separator theorem above, is the best that can be guaranteed: there are collections of shapes that cannot be separated in a better ratio using a separator that crosses only O(sqrt(''n'')) shapes. Here is one such collection (from theorem 34 of &lt;ref name=SmithWormald1998 /&gt;):

Consider an [[equilateral triangle]]. At each of its 3 vertices, put ''N''/3 shapes arranged in an exponential spiral, such that the diameter increases by a constant factor every turn of the spiral, and each shape touches its neighbours in the spiral ordering. For example, start with a 1-by-Φ rectangle, where Φ is the [[golden ratio]]. Add an adjacent Φ-by-Φ square and get another golden rectangle. Add an adjacent (1+Φ)-by-(1+Φ) square and get a larger golden rectangle, and so on.

Now, in order to separate more than 1/3 of the shapes, the separator must separate O(''N'') shapes from two different vertices. But to do this, the separator must intersect O(''N'') shapes.

== Separators that are hyperplanes ==

:: Given a set of ''N''=4''k'' disjoint axis-parallel rectangles in the plane, there is a line, either horizontal or vertical, such that at least ''N''/4 rectangles lie entirely to each side of it (thus at most ''N''/2 rectangles are intersected by the separator line).

=== Proof ===
Define ''W'' as the most western vertical line with at least ''N''/4 rectangles entirely to its west. There are two cases:
* If there are at least ''N''/4 rectangles entirely to the east of ''W'', then ''W'' is a vertical separator.
* Otherwise, by moving ''W'' slightly to the west, we get a vertical line that intersects more than ''N''/2 rectangles. Find a point on this line that has at least ''N''/4 rectangles above and ''N''/4 rectangles below it, and draw a horizontal separator through it.

=== Optimality ===
[[File:HyperplaneׂGeometricSeparatorCounterExample.svg|20px|right]]
The number of intersected shapes, guaranteed by the above theorem, is O(''N''). This upper bound is asymptotically tight even when the shapes are squares, as illustrated in the figure to the right. This is in sharp contrast to the upper bound of O({{radic|''N''}}) intersected shapes, which is guaranteed when the separator is a closed shape (see [[#Separators that are closed shapes|previous section]]).

[[File:HyperplaneׂGeometricSeparatorCounterExample2.svg|40px|right]]
Moreover, when the shapes are arbitrary rectangles, there are cases in which no line that separates more than a single rectangle can cross less than ''N''/4 rectangles, as illustrated in the figure to the right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=MvG|url=https://math.stackexchange.com/q/509928 |title=Cutting a cake without destroying the toppings|date=September 2013|accessdate=2014-01-13|publisher=Math Stack Exchange}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Generalizations ===
The above theorem can be generalized from disjoint rectangles to ''k''-thick rectangles. Additionally, by induction on ''d'', it is possible to generalize the above theorem to d dimensions and get the following theorem:&lt;ref name=SmithWormald1998/&gt;

:: Given ''N'' axis-parallel ''d''-boxes whose interiors are ''k''-thick, there exists an axis-parallel hyperplane such that at least:
::: &lt;math&gt;\lfloor(N+1-k)/(2d)\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;
:: of the ''d''-box interiors lie to each side of the hyperplane.

For the special case when ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 (i.e. each point is contained in at most ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 
boxes), the following theorem holds:&lt;ref name=SmithWormald1998/&gt;

:: Given ''N'' axis-parallel ''d''-boxes whose interiors are (''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-thick, there exists an axis-parallel hyperplane that separates two of them.

The objects need not be boxes, and the separators need not be axis-parallel:

:: Let ''C'' be a collection of possible orientations of hyperplanes (i.e. ''C''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{horizontal,vertical}). Given ''N'' ''d''-objects, such that every two disjoint object are separated by a hyperplane with an orientation from ''C'', whose interiors are ''k''-thick, there exists a hyperplane with an orientation from ''C'' such that at least: (''N''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'')/O(''C'') of the ''d''-objects interiors lie entirely to each side of the hyperplane.

=== Algorithmic versions ===

It is possible to find the hyperplanes guaranteed by the above theorems in O(''Nd'') steps. Also, if the 2''d'' lists of the lower and upper endpoints of the intervals defining the boxes's ''i''th coordinates are pre-sorted, then the best such hyperplane (according to a wide variety of optimality measures) may be found in O(''Nd'') steps.

== Separators that are width-bounded strips between parallel hyperplanes ==

:: Let ''Q'' be a set of ''n'' points in the plane such that the minimal distance between points is ''d''. Let ''a''&gt;0 be a constant.
:: There is a pair of parallel lines of distance&amp;nbsp;''a'', such that at most 2''n''/3 points lie to each side of the strip, and at most &lt;math&gt;1.3 {a \over d} \sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt; points lie inside the strip. 
:: Equivalently: there is a line such that at most 2''n''/3 points lie to each side of it and at most &lt;math&gt;1.3 {a \over d} \sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt; points lie at a distance of less than ''a''/2 from it.

=== Proof sketch ===
Define the ''centerpoint'' of ''Q'' as a point ''o'' such that every line through it has at most 2''n''/3 points of ''Q'' in each side of it. The existence of a centerpoint can be proved using [[Helly's theorem]].

For a given point ''p'' and constant ''a''&gt;0, define ''Pr(a,p,o)'' as the probability that a random line through ''o'' lies at a distance of less than ''a'' from ''p''. The idea is to bound this probability and thus bound the expected number of points at a distance less than ''a'' from a random line through ''o''. Then, by the [[pigeonhole principle]], at least one line through ''o'' is the desired separator.

=== Applications ===
Bounded-width separators can be used for approximately solving the [[protein folding]] problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1137/s0097539704440727| title = Geometric Separators and Their Applications to Protein Folding in the HP-Model| year = 2007| last1 = Fu | first1 = B. | last2 = Wang | first2 = W. | journal = SIAM Journal on Computing| volume = 37| issue = 4| pages = 1014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used for an exact sub-exponential algorithm to find a [[maximum independent set]], as well as several related covering problems, in geometric graphs.&lt;ref name="Fu"/&gt;

      <text bytes="4233" xml:space="preserve">[[File:Minimum bounding rectangle.svg|thumb|A series of geometric shapes enclosed by its minimum bounding box (in 2 dimensions)]]
In [[geometry]], the '''minimum''' or '''smallest bounding''' or '''enclosing box''' for a point set (''S'') in ''N'' dimensions is the box with the smallest [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] (area, volume, or  hypervolume in higher dimensions) within which all the points lie. When other kinds of measure are used, the minimum box is usually called accordingly, e.g., "minimum-perimeter bounding box".

The minimum bounding box of a point set is the same as the minimum bounding box of its [[convex hull]], a fact which may be used heuristically to speed up computation.&lt;ref name=tous83&gt;{{cite document

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "box"/"hyperrectangle" comes from its usage in the [[Cartesian coordinate system]], where it is indeed visualized as a rectangle (two-dimensional case), [[rectangular parallelepiped]] (three-dimensional case), etc.

In the two-dimensional case it is called the [[minimum bounding rectangle]].

==Axis-aligned minimum bounding box==
The [[axis-aligned]] minimum bounding box (or '''AABB''') for a given point set is its minimum bounding box subject to the constraint that the edges of the box are parallel to the (Cartesian) coordinate axes. It is the [[Cartesian product]] of ''N'' intervals each of which is defined by the minimal and maximal value of the corresponding coordinate for the points in ''S''.

Axis-aligned minimal bounding boxes are used to an approximate location of an object in question and as a very simple descriptor of its shape. For example, in [[computational geometry]] and its applications when it is required to find intersections in the set of objects, the initial check is the intersections between their MBBs. Since it is usually a much less expensive operation than the check of the actual intersection (because it only requires comparisons of coordinates), it allows quickly excluding checks of the pairs that are far apart.

==Arbitrarily oriented minimum bounding box==
The arbitrarily oriented minimum bounding box is the minimum bounding box, calculated subject to no constraints as to the orientation of the result. [[Minimum bounding box algorithms]] based on the [[rotating calipers]] method can be used to find the minimum-area or minimum-perimeter bounding box of a two-dimensional convex polygon in linear time, and of a two-dimensional point set in the time it takes to construct its [[convex hull]] followed by a linear-time computation.&lt;ref name=tous83/&gt; A three-dimensional rotating calipers algorithm can find the minimum-volume arbitrarily-oriented bounding box of a three-dimensional point set in cubic time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Joseph O'Rourke | title = Finding minimal enclosing boxes | publisher = [[Springer Netherlands]] | journal = Parallel Programming | year = 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matlab implementations of the latter as well as the optimal compromise between accuracy and CPU time are available. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |date=2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Object-oriented minimum bounding box==
In the case where an object has its own [[local coordinate system]], it can be useful to store a bounding box relative to these axes, which requires no transformation as the object's own transformation changes.

==Digital image processing==
In [[computer graphics|digital image processing]], the ''bounding box'' is merely the coordinates of the rectangular border that fully encloses a [[digital image]] when it is placed over a page, a canvas, a screen or other similar bidimensional background.

In mathematics, a '''subpaving''' is a set of nonoverlapping boxes of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;. A subset ''X'' of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; can be approximated by two subpavings ''X''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and ''X''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; such that ''X''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ⊂ ''X'' ⊂ ''X''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.
The three figures on the right show an approximation of the set ''X'' = {(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ∈ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; | ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 
sin(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ∈ [4,9]} with different accuracies.  The set ''X''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; corresponds to red boxes and the set ''X''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; contains all red and yellow boxes.

Combined with [[Interval arithmetic|interval-based methods]], subpavings are used to approximate the solution set of non-linear problems such as [[set inversion|set inversion problems]].

      <text bytes="4439" xml:space="preserve">In [[geometry]], an '''affine plane''' is a two-dimensional [[affine space]].

==Examples==
Typical examples of affine planes are
*[[Euclidean plane]]s, which are affine planes over the [[real number|reals]], equipped with a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]], the [[Euclidean distance]]. In other words, an affine plane over the reals is a Euclidean plane in which one has "forgotten" the metric (that is, one does not talk of lengths nor of angle measures). 
* [[Vector space]]s of dimension two, in which the [[zero vector]] is not considered as different from the other elements
* For every [[field (mathematics)|field]] or [[division ring]] ''F'', the set ''F''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the pairs of elements of ''F''
* The result of removing any single line (and all the points on this line) from any [[projective plane#Affine planes|projective plane]]

==Coordinates and isomorphism==
All the affine planes defined over a field are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]]. More precisely, the choice of an [[affine coordinate system]] (or, in the real case, a [[Cartesian coordinate system]]) for an affine plane ''P'' over a field ''F'' induces an isomorphism of affine planes between ''P'' and ''F''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

In the more general situation, where the affine planes are not defined over a field, they will in general not be isomorphic. Two affine planes arising from the same [[Non-Desarguesian plane|non-Desarguesian projective plane]] by the removal of different lines may not be isomorphic.

==Definitions==
There are two ways to formally define affine planes, which are equivalent for affine planes over a field. The first one consists in defining an affine plane as a set on which a vector space of dimension two [[Group action (mathematics)|acts simply transitively]]. Intuitively, this means that an affine plane is a vector space of dimension two in which one has "forgotten" where the origin is. In [[incidence geometry]], an [[affine plane (incidence geometry)|affine plane]] is defined as an abstract system of points and lines satisfying a system of axioms.

==Applications==
In the applications of mathematics, there are often situations where an affine plane without the Euclidean metric is used instead of the Euclidean plane. For example, in a [[Graph of a function|graph]], which can be drawn on paper, and in which the position of a particle is plotted against time, the Euclidean metric is not adequate for its interpretation, since the distances between its points or the measures of the angles between its lines have, in general, no physical importance (in the affine plane the axes can use different units, which are not comparable, and the measures also vary with different units and scales&lt;ref&gt;See also the books of [[Benoit Mandelbrot|Mandelbrot]], "Gaussian Self-Affinity and Fractals", of [[Howard Levi|Levi]], "Foundations of Geometry and Trigonometry", and of [[Isaak Yaglom|Yaglom]], "A Simple Non-Euclidean Geometry and its Physical Basis".&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Bamberg|author2=Shlomo Sternberg|author2-link=Shlomo Sternberg|title=A Course in Mathematics for Students of Physics|volume=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WgZ3Ia0SPE8C&amp;pg=PA1|date=1991|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-40649-9|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Howard Levi|author-link=Howard Levi|title=Topics in Geometry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F-NUAAAAYAAJ|date=1975|publisher=R.

In [[geometric topology]], '''Busemann functions''' are used to study the large-scale geometry of geodesics in [[Hadamard space]]s and in particular [[Hadamard manifold]]s ([[simply connected]] complete [[Riemannian manifold]]s of nonpositive curvature). They are named after [[Herbert Busemann]], who introduced them; he gave an extensive treatment of the topic in his 1955 book "The geometry of geodesics".

== Definition and elementary properties ==

Let &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[metric space]]. A [[Ray (geometry)|geodesic ray]] is a path &lt;math&gt;\gamma : [0,\infty) \to X&lt;/math&gt; which minimizes distance everywhere along its length. i.e., for all &lt;math&gt;t,t' \in [0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;, 
:&lt;math&gt;d\big(\gamma(t), \gamma(t') \big) = \big| t - t' \big|&lt;/math&gt;. 
Equivalently, a ray is an isometry from the "canonical ray" (the set &lt;math&gt;[0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; equipped with the Euclidean metric) into the metric space ''X''.

Given a ray ''γ'', the Busemann function &lt;math&gt;B_\gamma : X \to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;B_\gamma(x)=\lim_{t\to\infty}\big(d\big( \gamma(t), x \big)  - t \big)&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, when ''t'' is very large, the distance &lt;math&gt;d\big( \gamma(t), x \big)&lt;/math&gt; is approximately equal to &lt;math&gt;t - B_\gamma(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Given a ray ''γ'', its Busemann function is always well-defined: indeed the right hand side ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') above tends pointwise to the left hand side on compacta, since &lt;math&gt;t-d( \gamma(t), x )=d(\gamma(t),\gamma(0)) - d(\gamma(t),x)&lt;/math&gt; is bounded above by &lt;math&gt; d(\gamma(0),x)&lt;/math&gt; and increasing since, if &lt;math&gt;s\le t&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;t-s + d(x,\gamma(s)) - d(x,\gamma(t)) \ge t -s -d (\gamma(s),\gamma(t)) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

It is immediate from the triangle inequality that

:&lt;math&gt;|B_\gamma(x) - B_\gamma(y)|\le d(x,y),&lt;/math&gt;

so that &lt;math&gt;B_\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is uniformly continuous. More specifically, the above estimate above shows that

*'''''Busemann functions are [[Lipschitz function]]s with constant 1'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Busemann|1955|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By [[Dini's theorem]], the functions &lt;math&gt;F_t(x)=d(x,\gamma(t)) -t &lt;/math&gt; tend to &lt;math&gt;B_\gamma(x)&lt;/math&gt; uniformly on compact sets as ''t'' tends to infinity.

== Example: Poincaré disk ==

Let ''D'' be the unit disk in the complex plane with the Poincaré metric

:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = {4 \,|dz|^2 \over (1 - |z|^2)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then, for |z| &lt; 1 and |ζ| = 1, the Busemann function is given by

:&lt;math&gt; B_\zeta(z) = - \log \, \left({1 - |z|^2\over |z - \zeta|^2}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where the term in brackets on the right hand side is the [[Poisson kernel]] for the unit disk and ζ corresponds to the radial geodesic γ from the origin towards ζ,
γ(''t'') = ζ tanh(''t''/2). The computation of ''d''(''x'',''y'') can be reduced to that of ''d''(''z'',0) = ''d''(|''z''|,0) = tanh&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; |''z''| = log (1+|''z''|)/(1-|''z''|), since the metric is invariant under [[Möbius transformation]]s in SU(1,1); the geodesics through 0 have the form ζ ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(0) where ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is the 1-parameter subgroup of SU(1,1)

:&lt;math&gt;g_t=\begin{pmatrix}\cosh t/2 &amp; \sinh t/2 \\ \sinh t/2 &amp; \cosh t/2\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

The formula above also completely determines the Busemann function by Möbius invariance. Note that

:&lt;math&gt; {1 - |z|^2\over |z - \zeta|^2} \le {1-|z|^2\over (1-|z|)^2} = 1 -\left({|z|\over 1 - |z|}\right)^2 \le 1,&lt;/math&gt;

so that the Busemann function in this case is non-negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bridson|Haefliger|1999|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Busemann functions on a Hadamard space==

In a [[Hadamard space]], where any two points are joined by a unique geodesic segment, the function ''F'' = ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is ''convex'', i.e. convex on geodesic segments [''x'',''y'']. Explicitly this means that if ''z''(''s'') is the point which divides [''x'',''y''] in the ratio {{math|1=''s'' : (1 − ''s'') }}, then ''F''(''z''(''s'')) ≤ ''s'' ''F''(''x'') + (1 − ''s'') ''F''(''y'').  For fixed ''a'' the function ''d''(''x'',''a'') is convex and hence so are its translates; in particular, if γ is a geodesic ray in ''X'', then ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is convex. Since the Busemann function ''B''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt; is the pointwise limit of ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;,

*'''''Busemann functions are convex on Hadamard spaces'''''.&lt;ref name="BGS"&gt;{{harvnb|Ballmann|Gromov|Schroeder|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''On a Hadamard space, the functions &lt;math&gt;F_t(y)=d(y,\gamma(t)) -t &lt;/math&gt; converge uniformly to &lt;math&gt;B_\gamma&lt;/math&gt; uniformly on any bounded subset of X.'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bridson|Haefliger|1999|pages=268–269}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lurie|2010|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let {{math|1=''h''(''t'') = ''d''(''y'',γ(''t'')) − ''t'' = ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'')}}. Since γ(''t'') is parametrised by arclength, Alexandrov's first comparison theorem for Hadamard spaces implies that the function {{math|1=''g''(''t'') = ''d''(''y'',γ(''t''))&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is convex. Hence for 0&lt; ''s'' &lt; ''t''

:&lt;math&gt;g(s) \le (1-{s\over t})g(0) + {s\over t} g(t).&lt;/math&gt;

Thus

:&lt;math&gt;2sh(s)\le (h(s) +s)^2 - s^2 =g(s)  \le (1-{s\over t})d(x,y)^2 + {s\over t} ( 2th(t) +h(t)^2 )\le d(x,y)^2 + 2s h(t) +{s\over t} d(x,y)^2,&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt;|F_s(y) - F_t(y)|= |h(s) - h(t)| \le {1\over 2} (s^{-1} + t^{-1}) d(x,y)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Letting ''t'' tend to ∞, it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;|F_s(y) - B_\gamma(y)| \le {d(x,y)^2\over 2s},&lt;/math&gt;

so convergence is uniform on bounded sets.

Note that the inequality above for &lt;math&gt;|F_s(y) - F_t(y)| &lt;/math&gt; (together with its proof) also holds for geodesic segments: if Γ(''t'') is a geodesic segment starting at ''x'' and parametrised by arclength then

:&lt;math&gt;|d(y,\Gamma(s)) -s -d(y,\Gamma(t)) +t| \le (s^{-1} + t^{-1}) d(x,y)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Next suppose that ''x'', ''y''  are points in a Hadamard space, and let δ(''s'') be the geodesic through ''x'' with δ(0) = ''y'' and δ(''t'') = ''x'', where ''t'' = ''d''(''x'',''y''). This geodesic cuts the boundary of the closed ball {{overline|''B''}}(''y'',''r'') at the point δ(''r''). Thus if {{math|1=''d''(''x'',''y'') &gt; ''r''}}, there is a point ''v'' with {{math|1=''d''(''y'',''v'') = ''r''}} such that {{math|1=''d''(''x'',''v'')  = ''d''(''x'',''y'') − ''r''}}.

This condition persists for Busemann functions. The statement and proof of the property for Busemann functions relies on a fundamental theorem on closed convex subsets of a Hadamard space, which generalises [[orthogonal projection]] in a [[Hilbert space]]: if {{math|''C''}} is a closed convex set in a Hadamard space {{math|''X''}}, then every point {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''X''}} has a unique closest point {{math|1=''P''(''x'') ≡ ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} in {{math|''C''}} and {{math|1=''d''(''P''(''x''),''P''(''y'')) ≤ ''d''(''x'',''y'')}}; moreover {{math|1=''a'' = ''P''(''x'')}} is uniquely determined by the property that, for {{math|''y''}} in {{math|''C''}},

:&lt;math&gt;d(x,y)^2 \ge d(x,a) ^2 + d(a,y)^2,&lt;/math&gt;

so that the angle at {{math|''a''}} in the Euclidean [[comparison triangle]] for ''a'',''x'',''y'' is greater than or equal to {{pi}}/2.

*'''''If h is a Busemann function on a Hadamard space, then, given y in X and r &gt; 0, there is a unique point v with d(y,v) = r such that h(v) =  h(y) − r. For fixed r &gt; 0, the point v is the closest point of y to the closed convex C set of points u such that h(u) ≤ h(y) − r and therefore depends continuously on y.'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bridson|Haefliger|1999|pages=271–272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let ''v'' be the closest point to ''y'' in ''C''. Then ''h''(''v'') = ''h''(''y'') − ''r'' and so ''h'' is minimised by ''v'' in {{overline|''B''}}(''y'',''R'') where ''R'' = ''d''(''y'',''v'') and ''v'' is the unique point where ''h'' is minimised. By the Lipschitz condition ''r'' = |''h''(''y'') − ''h''(''v'')| ≤ ''R''. To prove the assertion, it suffices to show that ''R'' = ''r'', i.e. ''d''(''y'',''v'') = ''r''. On the other hand, ''h'' is the uniform limit on any closed ball of functions ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. On {{overline|''B''}}(''y'',''r''), these are minimised by points ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'') − ''r''. Hence the infimum of ''h'' on {{overline|''B''}}(''y'',''r'') is ''h''(''y'') − ''r'' and ''h''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) tends to ''h''(''y'') − ''r''. Thus ''h''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''h''(''y'') − ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''r'' and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; tending towards ''r''. Let ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; be the closest point to ''y'' with ''h''(''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ≤ ''h''(''y'') − ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Let ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''d''(''y'',''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ≤ ''r''. Then ''h''(''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) =  ''h''(''y'') − ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, and, by the Lipschitz condition on ''h'', ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. In particular ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; tends to ''r''. Passing to a subsequence if necessary it can be assumed that ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are both increasing (to ''r''). The inequality for convex optimisation implies that for ''n'' &gt; ''m''.

:&lt;math&gt; d(u_n,u_m)^2 \le R_n^2 - R_m^2\le 2r|R_n -R_m|,&lt;/math&gt;

so that ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a Cauchy sequence. If ''u'' is its limit, then ''d''(''y'',''u'') = ''r'' and ''h''(''u'') = ''h''(''y'') − ''r''. By uniqueness it follows that ''u'' = ''v'' and hence ''d''(''y'',''v'') = ''r'', as required.

'''Uniform limits.''' The above argument proves more generally that if ''d''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) tends to infinity and the functions ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''d''(''x'',''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) – ''d''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) tend uniformly on bounded sets to ''h''(''x''), then ''h'' is convex, Lipschitz with Lipschitz constant 1 and, given ''y'' in ''X'' and ''r'' &gt; 0, there is a unique point ''v'' with ''d''(''y'',''v'') = ''r'' such that ''h''(''v'') =  ''h''(''y'') − ''r''. If on the other hand the sequence (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is bounded, then the terms all lie in some closed ball and uniform convergence there implies that (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a Cauchy sequence so converges to some ''x''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; in ''X''. So ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; tends uniformly to ''h''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''d''(''x'',''x''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;) – ''d''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), a function of the same form. The same argument also shows that the class of functions which satisfy the same three conditions (being convex, Lipschitz and having minima on closed balls) is closed under taking uniform limits on bounded sets.

'''Comment.''' Note that, since any closed convex subset of a Hadamard subset of a Hadamard space is also a Hadamard space, any closed ball in a Hadamard space is a Hadamard space. In particular it need not be the case that every geodesic segment is contained in a geodesic defined on the whole of '''R''' or even a semi-infinite interval [0,∞). The closed unit ball of a Hilbert space gives an explicit example which is not a proper metric space.

*'''''If h is a convex function, Lipschitz with constant 1 and h assumes its minimum on any closed ball centred on y with radius r at a unique point v on the boundary with h(v) = h(y) − r, then for each y in X there is a unique geodesic ray δ such that δ(0) = y and δ cuts each closed convex set h ≤ h(y) – r with r &gt; 0 at δ(r), so that h(δ(t)) = h(y) – t. In particular this holds for each Busemann function.'''''&lt;ref name="Bridson 1999 pages=271–272"&gt;{{harvnb|Bridson|Haefliger|1999|pages=271–272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third condition implies that ''v'' is the closest point to ''y'' in the closed convex set ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; of points ''u'' such that ''h''(''u'') ≤ ''h''(''y'') – ''r''. Let δ(''t'') for 0 ≤ ''t'' ≤ ''r'' be the geodesic joining ''y'' to ''v''. Then ''k''(''t'') = ''h''(δ(''t'')) - ''h''(''y'') is a convex Lipschitz function on [0,''r''] with Lipschitz constant 1 satisfying ''k''(''t'') ≤ – ''t'' and ''k''(0) = 0 and ''k''(''r'') = –''r''. So ''k'' vanishes everywhere, since if 0 &lt; ''s'' &lt; ''r'', ''k''(''s'') ≤ –''s'' and |''k''(s)| ≤ ''s''. Hence ''h''(δ(''t'')) = ''h''(''y'') – ''t''. By uniqueness it follows that δ(''t'') is the closest point to ''y'' in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; and that it is the unique point minimising ''h'' in {{overline|''B''}}(''y'',''t''). Uniqueness implies that these geodesics segments coincide for arbitrary ''r'' and therefore that δ extends to a geodesic ray with the stated property.

*'''''If h = h&lt;sub&gt;γ &lt;/sub&gt;, then the geodesic ray δ starting at y satisfies''''' &lt;math&gt;\sup d(\gamma(t),\delta(t)) &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;. '''''If δ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is another ray starting at y with''''' &lt;math&gt;\sup d(\delta(t),\delta_1(t)) &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt; '''''then δ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = δ.'''''

To prove the first assertion, it is enough to check this for ''t'' sufficiently large. In that case γ(''t'') and δ(''t'' − ''h''(''y'')) are the projections of ''x'' and ''y'' onto the closed convex set {{math|1=''h'' ≤ −''t''}}. Therefore, ''d''(γ(''t''),δ(''t'' − ''h''(''y''))) ≤ ''d''(''x'',''y''). Hence  ''d''(γ(''t''),δ(''t'')) ≤ ''d''(γ(''t''),δ(''t'' − ''h''(''y''))) + ''d''(δ(''t'' − ''h''(''y'')),δ(''t'')) ≤ ''d''(''x'',''y'') + |''h''(''y'')|. The second assertion follows because ''d''(δ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''),δ(''t'')) is convex and bounded on [0,∞), so, if it vanishes at ''t'' = 0, must vanish everywhere.

*'''''Suppose that h is a continuous convex function and for each y in X there is a unique geodesic ray δ such that δ(0) = y and δ cuts each closed convex set h ≤ h(y) – r with r &gt; 0 at δ(r), so that h(δ(t)) = h(y) – t; then h is a Busemann function. h − h&lt;sub&gt;δ&lt;/sub&gt; is a constant function.'''''&lt;ref name="Bridson 1999 pages=271–272"/&gt;

Let ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; be the closed convex set of points ''z'' with ''h''(''z'') ≤ −''r''. Since ''X'' is a Hadamard space for every point ''y'' in ''X'' there is a unique closest point ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'') to ''y'' in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;. It depends continuously on ''y'' and if ''y'' lies outside ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'') lies on the hypersurface ''h''(''z'') = − ''r''—the boundary ∂''C''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;—and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'') satisfies the inequality of convex optimisation. Let δ(''s'') be the geodesic ray starting at ''y''.

Fix ''x'' in ''X''. Let γ(''s'') be the geodesic ray starting at ''x''. Let ''g''(''z'') = ''h''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;(''z''), the Busemann function for γ with base point ''x''. In particular ''g''(''x'') = 0. It suffices to show that {{math|1=''g'' = ''h'' – ''h''(''y'')1}}. Now take ''y'' with ''h''(''x'') = ''h''(''y'') and let δ(''t'') be the geodesic ray starting at ''y'' corresponding to ''h''. Then

:&lt;math&gt;d(x,y) \ge d(\gamma(t),\delta(t)),\,\,\, d(x,\delta(t))^2 \ge d(x,\gamma(t))^2+d(\gamma(t),\delta(t))^2,\,\,\,d(y,\gamma(t))^2 \ge d(y,\delta(t))^2+d(\gamma(t),\delta(t))^2.&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, for any four points ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' in a Hadamard space, the following quadrilateral inequality of [[Yurii Reshetnyak|Reshetnyak]] holds:

:&lt;math&gt; |d(a,c)^2 + d(b,d)^2 - d(a,d)^2 - d(b,d)^2|\le 2 d(a,b)d(c,d).&lt;/math&gt;

Setting ''a'' = ''x'', ''b'' = ''y'', ''c'' = γ(''t''), ''d'' =  δ(''t''), it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;|d(y,\gamma(t))^2 - d(x,\delta(t))^2|\le 2d(x,y)^2,&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt;|d(y,\gamma(t)) - d(x,\gamma(t))|\le  2 {d(x,y)^2\over d(y,\gamma(t)) + d(x,\gamma(t))}\le {d(x,y)^2\over t}.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence ''h''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'') = 0. Similarly ''h''&lt;sub&gt;δ&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = 0. Hence ''h''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'') = 0 on the level surface of ''h'' containing ''x''. Now for ''t'' ≥ 0 and ''z'' in ''X'', let α&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'') = γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') the geodesic ray starting at ''z''. Then {{math|1=α&lt;sub&gt;''s'' + ''t''&lt;/sub&gt; = α&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; ∘  α&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|1=''h'' ∘ α&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''h''  − ''t''}}. Moreover, by boundedness, {{math|1=''d''(α&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(''u''),α&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(''v'')) ≤ ''d''(''u'',''v'')}}. The flow α&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; can be used to transport this result to all the level surfaces of ''h''. For general ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, if ''h''(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt; ''h''(''x''), take ''s'' &gt; 0 such that ''h''(α&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')) = ''h''(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and set ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = α&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''). Then ''h''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0, where γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') = α&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = γ(''s'' + ''t''). But then ''h''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = ''h''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt; – ''s'', so that ''h''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''s''. Hence {{math|1=''g''(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''s'' = ''h''((α&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')) – ''h''(''x'') = ''h''(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) – ''h''(''x'')}}, as required. Similarly if ''h''(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) &gt; ''h''(''x''), take
''s'' &gt; 0 such that ''h''(α&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)) = ''h''(''x''). Let ''y'' = α&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). Then
''h''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'') = 0, so ''h''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = –''s''. Hence {{math|1=''g''(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = –''s'' =  ''h''(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) – ''h''(''x'')}}, as required.

Finally there are necessary and sufficient conditions for two geodesics to define the same Busemann function up to constant:

*'''''On a Hadamard space, the Busemann functions of two geodesic rays &lt;math&gt;\gamma_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_2&lt;/math&gt; differ by a constant if and only if &lt;math&gt;\sup_{t\ge 0} d(\gamma_1(t),\gamma_2(t)) &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;.'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dal'bo|Peigné|Sambusetti|2012|pages=94–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suppose firstly that γ and δ are two geodesic rays with Busemann functions differing by a constant. Shifting the argument of one of the geodesics by a constant, it may be assumed that ''B''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt; = ''B''&lt;sub&gt;δ&lt;/sub&gt; = ''B'', say. Let ''C'' be the closed convex set on which ''B''(''x'') ≤ −''r''. Then ''B''(γ(''t'')) = ''B''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;(γ(''t'')) = −''t'' and similarly ''B''(δ(''t'')) = − ''t''. Then for ''s'' ≤ ''r'', the points γ(''s'') and  δ(''s'') have closest points γ(''r'') and  δ(''r'') in ''C'', so that ''d''(γ(''r''), δ(''r'')) ≤ ''d''(γ(''s''), δ(''s'')). Hence {{math|1=sup&lt;sub&gt;''t'' ≥ 0&lt;/sub&gt; ''d''(γ(''t''), δ(''t'')) &lt; ∞}}.

Now suppose that {{math|1=sup&lt;sub&gt;''t'' ≥ 0&lt;/sub&gt; ''d''(γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')) &lt; ∞}}. Let δ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') be the geodesic ray starting at ''y'' associated with ''h''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;. Then {{math|1=sup&lt;sub&gt;''t'' ≥ 0&lt;/sub&gt; ''d''(γ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), δ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')) &lt; ∞}}. Hence {{math|1=sup&lt;sub&gt;''t'' ≥ 0&lt;/sub&gt; ''d''(δ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), δ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')) &lt; ∞}}. Since δ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and δ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; both start at ''y'', it follows that δ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') ≡ δ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''). By the previous result ''h''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and ''h''&lt;sub&gt;δ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; differ by a constant; so ''h''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and ''h''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; differ by a constant.

To summarise, the above results give the following characterisation of Busemann functions on a Hadamard space:&lt;ref name="Bridson 1999 pages=271–272"/&gt;

'''THEOREM.''' '''''On a Hadamard space, the following conditions on a function f are equivalent:'''''

*'''''h is a Busemann function.'''''
*'''''h is a convex function, Lipschitz with constant 1 and h assumes its minimum on any closed ball centred on y with radius r at a unique point v on the boundary with h(v) = h(y) − r.'''''

==Bordification of a Hadamard space==
In the previous section it was shown that if ''X'' is a Hadamard space and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a fixed point in ''X'' then the union of the space of Busemann functions vanishing at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and the space of functions ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''d''(''x'',''y'') − ''d''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''y'') is closed under taking uniform limits on bounded sets. This result can be formalised in the notion of '''bordification''' of ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bridson|Haefliger|1999|pages=260–276}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this topology, the points ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; tend to a geodesic ray γ starting at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if ''d''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) tends to ∞ and for ''t''  &gt; 0 arbitrarily large the sequence obtained by taking the point on each segment [''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] at a distance ''t'' from ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; tends to γ(''t'').

If ''X'' is a metric space, Gromov's bordification can be defined as follows. Fix a point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in ''X'' and let ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; = {{overline|''B''}}(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''N''). Let ''Y'' = ''C''(''X'') be the space of Lipschitz continuous functions on ''X'', .e. those for which |''f''(''x'')  – ''f''(''y'')| ≤ ''A'' ''d''(''x'',''y'') for some constant ''A'' &gt; 0. The space ''Y'' can be topologised by the seminorms ||''f''||&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; = sup&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; |''f''|, the topology of uniform convergence on bounded sets. The seminorms are finite by the Lipschitz conditions. This is the topology induced by the natural map of ''C''(''X'') into the direct product of the Banach spaces ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;) of continuous bounded functions on ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;. It is give by the metric ''D''(''f'',''g'') = ∑ 2&lt;sup&gt;−''N''&lt;/sup&gt; ||''f'' − ''g''||&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;(1 +||''f'' − ''g''||&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

The space ''X'' is embedded into ''Y'' by sending ''x'' to the function ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'') = ''d''(''y'',''x'') – ''d''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''). Let {{overline|''X''}} be the closure of ''X'' in ''Y''. Then {{overline|''X''}} is metrisable, since ''Y'' is, and contains ''X'' as an open subset; moreover bordifications arising from different choices of basepoint are naturally homeomorphic.  Let ''h''(''x'') = (''d''(''x'',''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) + 1)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Then ''h'' lies in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''). It is non-zero on ''X'' and vanishes only at ∞. Hence it extends to a continuous function on {{overline|''X''}} with zero set  {{overline|''X''}} \ ''X''. It follows that {{overline|''X''}} \ ''X'' is closed in {{overline|''X''}}, as required. To check that {{overline|''X''}} = {{overline|''X''}}(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is independent of the basepoint, it suffices to show that ''k''(''x'') = ''d''(''x'',''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) − ''d''(''x'',''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) extends to a continuous function on {{overline|''X''}}. But ''k''(''x'') = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), so, for ''g'' in {{overline|''X''}}, ''k''(''g'') = ''g''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). Hence the correspondence between the compactifications for ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is given by sending ''g'' in {{overline|''X''}}(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) to ''g'' + ''g''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)1 in {{overline|''X''}}(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;).

When ''X'' is a Hadamard space, Gromov's ideal boundary ∂''X'' = {{overline|''X''}} \ ''X'' can be realised explicitly as "asymptotic limits" of geodesic rays using Busemann functions. If ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is an unbounded sequence in ''X'' with ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''d''(''x'',''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) − ''d''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)  tending to ''h'' in ''Y'', then ''h'' vanishes at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, is convex, Lipschitz with Lipschitz constant 1 and has minimum ''h''(''y'') − ''r'' on any closed ball {{overline|''B''}}(''y'',''r''). Hence ''h'' is a Busemann function ''B''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt; corresponding to a unique geodesic ray γ starting at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

On the other hand, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; tends to ''B''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt; uniformly on bounded sets if and only if  ''d''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) tends to ∞ and for ''t''  &gt; 0 arbitrarily large the sequence obtained by taking the point on each segment [''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] at a distance ''t'' from ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; tends to γ(''t''). For ''d''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ≥ ''t'', let ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') be the point in [''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] with ''d''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')) = ''t''. Suppose first that ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; tends to ''B''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt; uniformly on {{overline|''B''}}(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''R''). Then for ''t'' ≤ ''R'',
|''h''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(γ(''t'')) – ''B''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;(γ(''t''))|=''d''(γ(''t''),''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) – ''d''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) + ''t''. This is a convex function. It vanishes as ''t'' = 0 and hence is increasing. So it is maximised at ''t'' = ''R''. So for each ''t'', |''d''(γ(''t''),''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) – ''d''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) – ''t''| tends towards 0. Let ''a'' = ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b'' = γ(''t'') and ''c'' = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Then ''d''(''c'',''a'') – ''d''(''c'',''b'') is close to ''d''(''a'',''b'') with ''d''(''c'',''a'') large. Hence in the Euclidean comparison triangle ''CA'' - ''CB'' is close to ''AB'' with ''CA'' large. So the angle at ''A'' is small. So the point ''D'' on ''AC'' at the same distance as ''AB'' lies close to ''B''. Hence, by the first comparison theorem for geodesic triangles, ''d''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''),γ(''t'')) is small. Conversely suppose that for fixed ''t'' and ''n'' sufficiently large ''d''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''),γ(''t'')) tends to 0. Then from the above  ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'') = ''d''(''y'',γ(''s'')) – ''s'' satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;|F_s(y) - B_\gamma(y)| \le {d(x_0,y)^2\over 2s},&lt;/math&gt;

so it suffices show that on any bounded set ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'') = ''d''(''y'',''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) – ''d''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is uniformly close to ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'') for ''n'' sufficiently large.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ballmann|1995|pages=27–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a fixed ball {{overline|''B''}}(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''R''), fix ''s'' so that ''R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''s'' ≤ ε.  The claim is then an immediate consequence of the inequality for geodesic segments in a Hadamard space, since

:&lt;math&gt;|d(y,x_n) -d(y,x_0) - d(y,x_n(s)) + s |\le  {d(x_0,y)^2\over s} \le \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, if ''y'' in {{overline|''B''}}(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''R'') and ''n'' is sufficiently large that ''d''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''s''),γ(''s'')) ≤ ε, then

:&lt;math&gt;|h_n(y)-B_\gamma(y)|=|d(y,x_n) -d(y,x_0) - B_\gamma(y)| \le |d(y,x_n) -d(y,x_0) - d(y,x_n(s)) + s | + d(x_n(s),\gamma(s)) + |F_s(y) - B_\gamma(y)| \le 3\varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

== Busemann functions on a Hadamard manifold ==

Suppose that ''x'', ''y''  are points in a Hadamard manifold and let ''γ''(''s'') be the geodesic through ''x'' with ''γ''(0) = ''y''. This geodesic cuts the boundary of the closed ball {{overline|''B''}}(''y'',''r'') at the two points γ(±''r''). Thus if ''d''(''x'',''y'') &gt; ''r'', there are points ''u'', ''v'' with ''d''(''y'',''u'') = ''d''(''y'',''v'') = ''r'' such that |''d''(''x'',''u'') − ''d''(''x'',''v'')| = 2''r''. By continuity this condition persists for Busemann functions:

*'''''If h is a Busemann function on a Hadamard manifold, then, given y in X and r &gt; 0, there are unique points u, v with d(y,u) = d(y,v) = r such that h(u) = h(y) + r and  h(v) =  h(y) − r. For fixed ''r'' &gt; 0, the points ''u'' and ''v'' depend continuously on ''y''.&lt;ref name="BGS"/&gt;

Taking a sequence ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; tending to ∞ and ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, there are points ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; which satisfy these conditions for ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''n'' sufficiently large. Passing to a subsequence if necessary, it can be assumed that ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; tend to ''u'' and ''v''. By continuity these points satisfy the conditions for ''h''. To prove uniqueness, note that by compactness ''h'' assumes its maximum and minimum on {{overline|''B''}}(''y'',''r''). The Lipschitz condition shows that the values of ''h'' there differ by at most 2''r''. Hence ''h'' is minimized at ''v'' and maximized at ''u''. On the other hand, ''d''(''u'',''v'') = 2''r'' and for ''u'' and ''v'' the points ''v'' and ''u'' are the unique points in {{overline|''B''}}(''y'',''r'') maximizing this distance. The Lipschitz condition on ''h'' then immediately implies ''u'' and ''v'' must be the unique points in {{overline|''B''}}(''y'',''r'') maximizing and minimizing ''h''. Now suppose that ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; tends to ''y''. Then the corresponding points ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; lie in a closed ball so admit convergent subsequences. But by uniqueness of ''u'' and ''v'' any such subsequences must tend to ''u'' and ''v'', so that ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;
must tend to ''u'' and ''v'', establishing continuity.

The above result holds more generally in a Hadamard space.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bridson|haefliger|1999|pages=271–272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''''If h is a Busemann function on a Hadamard manifold, then h is continuously differentiable with ||dh(y)|| = 1 for all y.'''''&lt;ref name="BGS"/&gt;

From the previous properties of ''h'', for each ''y'' there is a unique geodesic γ(''t'') parametrised by arclength with γ(0) = ''y'' such that  {{math|1=''h'' ∘ γ(''t'') = ''h''(''y'') + ''t''}}. It has the property that it cuts ∂''B''(''y'',''r'') at ''t'' = ±''r'': in the previous notation γ(''r'') = ''u'' and  γ(–''r'') = ''v''. The vector field ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt; defined by the unit vector &lt;math&gt;\dot{\gamma}(0)&lt;/math&gt; at ''y'' is continuous, because ''u'' is a continuous function of ''y'' and the map  sending (''x'',''v'')  to (''x'',exp&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; ''v'') is a diffeomorphism from ''TX'' onto ''X'' × ''X'' by the [[Cartan-Hadamard theorem]]. Let δ(''s'') be another geodesic parametrised by arclength through ''y'' with δ(0) = ''y''. Then ''dh'' ∘ δ  (0)/ ''ds'' = &lt;math&gt;(\dot{\delta}(0),\dot{\gamma}(0))&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, let ''H''(''x'') = ''h''(''x'') − ''h''(''y''), so that ''H''(''y'') = 0. Then

:&lt;math&gt; |H(\delta(s)) - H(x)| \le d(\delta(s),x).&lt;/math&gt;

Applying this with ''x'' = ''u'' and ''v'', it follows that for ''s'' &gt; 0

:&lt;math&gt;(r- d(\delta(s),u))/s \le (h(\delta(s)) - h(y))/s \le (d(\delta(s),v) -r)/s.&lt;/math&gt;

The outer terms tend to &lt;math&gt;(\dot{\delta}(0),\dot{\gamma}(0))&lt;/math&gt; as ''s'' tends to 0, so the middle term has the same limit, as claimed. A similar argument applies for ''s'' &lt; 0.

The assertion on the outer terms follows from the first variation formula for arclength, but can be deduced directly as follows. Let 
&lt;math&gt;a=\dot{\delta}(0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b=\dot{\gamma}(0)&lt;/math&gt;, both unit vectors. Then for tangent vectors ''p'' and ''q'' at ''y'' in the unit ball&lt;ref&gt;In [[geodesic normal coordinates]], the metric ''g''(''x'') = I + ε ||''x''||. By geodesic convexity, a geodesic from ''p'' to ''q'' lies in the ball of radius ''r'' = max ||''p''||, ||''q''||. The straight line segment gives an upper estimate for ''d''(''p'',''q'') of the stated form. To obtain a similar lower estimate, observe that if ''c''(''t'') is a smooth path from ''p'' to ''q'', then ''L''(''c'') ≥  (1 − ε ''r'') ⋅ ∫ || ''c'  ''|| ''dt'' ≥  (1 − ε ''r'') ⋅ ||''p'' − ''q''||. (Note that these inequalities can be improved using the sharper estimate ''g''(''x'') = I + ε ||''x''||&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.)&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;d(\exp_y p,\exp_y q) = \|p-q\| + \varepsilon \max \|p\|^2, \|q\|^2&lt;/math&gt;
 
with ε uniformly bounded. Let ''s'' = ''t''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and ''r'' = ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Then

:&lt;math&gt;(d(\delta(s),v) -r)/s= (d(\exp_y(t^3 a),\exp_y(-t^2 b)) - t^2)/t^3 = (\|t^3a +t^2b\| - t^2)/t^3 + \varepsilon |t|= (\|ta +b\| -1)/t + \varepsilon |t|.&lt;/math&gt;

The right hand side here tends to (''a'',''b'') as ''t'' tends to 0 since

:&lt;math&gt; {d\over dt} \|b + t a\||_{t=0 }= {1\over 2} \,{d\over dt} \|b + t a\|^2|_{t=0} = (a,b).&lt;/math&gt;

The same method works for the other terms.

Hence it follows that ''h'' is a C&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; function with ''dh'' dual to the vector field ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt;, so that ||''dh''(''y'')|| = 1.  The vector field ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt; is thus the [[gradient vector field]] for ''h''. The geodesics through any point are the flow lines for the flow α&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt;, so that α&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[gradient flow]] for ''h''.

'''THEOREM.''' '''''On a Hadamard manifold X the following conditions on a  continuous function h are equivalent:'''''&lt;ref name="BGS"/&gt;
# '''''h is a Busemann function.'''''
# '''''h is a convex, Lipschitz function with constant 1, and for each y in X there are points u&lt;sub&gt;±&lt;/sub&gt; at a distance r from y such that h(u&lt;sub&gt;±&lt;/sub&gt;) = h(y) ± r.'''''
# '''''h is a convex C&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; function with ||dh(x)|| ≡ 1.'''''

It has already been proved that (1) implies (2).

The arguments above show ''[[mutatis mutandi]]'' that (2) implies (3).

It therefore remains to show that (3) implies (1). Fix ''x'' in ''X''. Let α&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; be the gradient flow for ''h''. It follows that {{math|1=''h'' ∘ α&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; (''x'') = ''h''(''x'') + ''t''}} and that {{math|1=γ(''t'') = α&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} is a geodesic through ''x'' parametrised by arclength with {{math|1=γ(0) = ''x''}}. Indeed, if ''s'' &lt; ''t'', then

:&lt;math&gt;|s-t|=|h(\alpha_s(x))-h(\alpha_t(x))| \le d(\alpha_s(x),\alpha_t(x))\le \int_{s}^t \|d\alpha_\tau(x)/d\tau\|  \, d\tau =\int_s^t \|dh(\alpha_\tau(x))\| \, d\tau = |s-t|,&lt;/math&gt;

so that ''d''(γ(''s''),γ(''t'')) = |''s'' − ''t''|. Let ''g''(''y'') = ''h''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''), the Busemann function for γ with base point ''x''. In particular ''g''(''x'') = 0. To prove (1), it suffices to show that ''g'' = ''h'' – ''h''(''x'')1.

Let ''C''(−''r'') be the closed convex set of points ''z'' with ''h''(''z'') ≤ −''r''. Since ''X'' is a Hadamard space for every point ''y'' in ''X'' there is a unique closest point ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'') to ''y'' in ''C''(-''r''). It depends continuously on ''y'' and if ''y'' lies outside ''C''(-''r''), then ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'') lies on the hypersurface ''h''(''z'') = − ''r''—the boundary ∂''C''(–''r'') of ''C''(–''r'')—and the geodesic from ''y'' to ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'') is orthogonal to ∂''C''(–''r''). In this case the geodesic is just α&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''). Indeed, the fact that α&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is the gradient flow of ''h'' and the conditions ||''dh''(''y'')|| ≡ 1 imply that the flow lines  α&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'') are geodesics parametrised by arclength and cut the level curves of ''h'' orthogonally. Taking ''y'' with ''h''(''y'') = ''h''(''x'') and  ''t'' &gt; 0,

:&lt;math&gt;d(x,y) \ge d(\alpha_t(x),\alpha_t(y)),\,\,\, d(x,\alpha_t(y))^2 \ge d(x,\alpha_t(x))^2+d(\alpha_t(x),\alpha_t(y))^2,\,\,\,d(y,\alpha_t(x))^2 \ge d(y,\alpha_t(y))^2+d(\alpha_t(x),\alpha_t(y))^2.&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, for any four points ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' in a Hadamard space, the following quadrilateral inequality of [[Yurii Reshetnyak|Reshetnyak]] holds:

:&lt;math&gt; |d(a,c)^2 + d(b,d)^2 - d(a,d)^2 - d(b,d)^2|\le 2 d(a,b)d(c,d).&lt;/math&gt;

Setting ''a'' = ''x'', ''b'' = ''y'', ''c'' = α&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), ''d'' =  α&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''), it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;|d(y,\alpha_t(x))^2 - d(x,\alpha_t(x))^2|\le 2d(x,y)^2,&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt;|d(y,\alpha_t(x)) - d(x,\alpha_t(x))|\le  2 {d(x,y)^2\over d(y,\alpha_t(x)) + d(x,\alpha_t(x))}\le {d(x,y)^2\over t}.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence ''h''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'') = 0 on the level surface of ''h'' containing ''x''. The flow α&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; can be used to transport this result to all the level surfaces of ''h''. For general ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; take ''s'' such that ''h''(α&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')) = ''h''(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and set ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = α&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''). Then ''h''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0, where γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') = α&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = γ(''s'' + ''t''). But then ''h''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = ''h''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt; – ''s'', so that ''h''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''s''. Hence {{math|1=''g''(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''s'' = ''h''((α&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')) – ''h''(''x'') = ''h''(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) – ''h''(''x'')}}, as required.

Note that this argument could be shortened using the fact that two Busemann functions ''h''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt; and ''h''&lt;sub&gt;δ&lt;/sub&gt; differ by a constant if and only if the corresponding geodesic rays satisfy sup&lt;sub&gt;''t'' ≥ 0&lt;/sub&gt; ''d''(γ(''t''),δ(''t'')) &lt; ∞. Indeed, all the geodesics defined by the flow α&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; satisfy the latter condition, so differ by constants. Since along any of these geodesics ''h'' is linear with derivative 1, ''h'' must differ from these Busemann functions by constants.

==Compactification of a proper Hadamard space==
{{harvtxt|Eberlein|O'Neill|1973}} defined a compactification of a [[Hadamard manifold]] ''X'' which uses Busemann functions. Their construction, which can be extended more generally to proper (i.e. locally compact) [[Hadamard space]]s, gives an explicit geometric realisation of a compactification defined by Gromov—by adding an "ideal boundary"—for the more general class of [[proper metric space]]s ''X'', those for which every closed ball is compact. Note that, since any Cauchy sequence is contained in a closed ball, any proper metric space is automatically complete.&lt;ref&gt;Note that a metric space ''X''  which is complete and locally compact need not be proper, for example '''R''' with the metric ''d''(''x'',''y'') = |''x'' – ''y''|/(1 + |''x'' – ''y''|). On the other hand, by the [[Hopf–Rinow theorem]] for metric spaces, if ''X'' is complete, locally compact and geodesic—every two points ''x'' and ''y'' are joined by a geodesic parametrised by arclength—then ''X'' is proper (see {{harvnb|Bridson|Haefliger|1999|pages=35–36}}). Indeed if not, there is a point ''x'' in ''X'' and a closed ball ''K'' = {{overline|''B''}}(''x'',''r'') maximal subject to being compact; then, since by hypothesis {{overline|''B''}}(''x'',''R'') is non-compact for each ''R'' &gt; ''r'', a diagonal argument shows that there is a sequence (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) with ''d''(''x'',''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) decreasing to ''r'' but with no convergent subsequence; on the other hand taking ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; on a geodesic joining ''x'' and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, with ''d''(''x'',''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''r'', compactness of  ''K'' implies (''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), and hence (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), has a convergent subsequence, a contradiction.&lt;/ref&gt; The ideal boundary is a special case of the ideal boundary for a metric space. In the case of Hadamard spaces, this agrees with the space of geodesic rays emanating from any fixed point described using Busemann functions in the bordification of the space.

If ''X'' is a proper metric space, Gromov's compactification can be defined as follows. Fix a point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in ''X'' and let ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; = {{overline|''B''}}(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''N''). Let ''Y'' = ''C''(''X'') be the space of Lipschitz continuous functions on ''X'', .e. those for which |''f''(''x'')  – ''f''(''y'')| ≤ ''A'' ''d''(''x'',''y'') for some constant ''A'' &gt; 0. The space ''Y'' can be topologised by the seminorms ||''f''||&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; = sup&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; |''f''|, the topology of uniform convergence on compacta. This is the topology induced by the natural map of ''C''(''X'') into the direct product of the Banach spaces ''C''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;). It is give by the metric ''D''(''f'',''g'') = ∑ 2&lt;sup&gt;−''N''&lt;/sup&gt; ||''f'' − ''g''||&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;(1 +||''f'' − ''g''||&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

The space ''X'' is embedded into ''Y'' by sending ''x'' to the function ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'') = ''d''(''y'',''x'') – ''d''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''). Let {{overline|''X''}} be the closure of ''X'' in ''Y''. Then {{overline|''X''}} is compact (metrisable) and contains ''X'' as an open subset; moreover compactifications arising from different choices of basepoint are naturally homeomorphic. Compactness follows from the [[Arzelà–Ascoli theorem]] since the image in ''C''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;) is [[equicontinuous]] and uniformly bounded in norm by ''N''. Let ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; be a sequence in ''X'' ⊂ {{overline|''X''}} tending to ''y'' in {{overline|''X''}} \ ''X''. Then all but finitely many terms must lie outside ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; since ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; is compact, so that any subsequence would converge to a point in ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;; so the sequence ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; must be unbounded in ''X''. Let ''h''(''x'') = (''d''(''x'',''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) + 1)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Then ''h'' lies in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''). It is non-zero on ''X'' and vanishes only at ∞. Hence it extends to a continuous function on {{overline|''X''}} with zero set  {{overline|''X''}} \ ''X''. It follows that {{overline|''X''}} \ ''X'' is closed in {{overline|''X''}}, as required. To check that the compactification  {{overline|''X''}} = {{overline|''X''}}(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is independent of the basepoint, it suffices to show that ''k''(''x'') = ''d''(''x'',''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) − ''d''(''x'',''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) extends to a continuous function on {{overline|''X''}}. But ''k''(''x'') = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), so, for ''g'' in {{overline|''X''}}, ''k''(''g'') = ''g''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). Hence the correspondence between the compactifications for ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is given by sending ''g'' in {{overline|''X''}}(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) to ''g'' + ''g''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)1 in {{overline|''X''}}(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;).

When ''X'' is a Hadamard manifold (or more generally a proper Hadamard space), Gromov's ideal boundary ∂''X'' = {{overline|''X''}} \ ''X'' can be realised explicitly as "asymptotic limits" of geodesics by using Busemann functions. Fixing a base point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a unique geodesic γ(''t'') parametrised by arclength such that γ(0) = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot{\gamma}(0)&lt;/math&gt; is a given unit vector. If ''B''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt; is the corresponding Busemann function, then
''B''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt; lies in ∂''X''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and induces a homeomorphism of the unit (''n'' − 1)-sphere onto  ∂''X''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), sending &lt;math&gt;\dot{\gamma}(0)&lt;/math&gt; to ''B''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Quasigeodesics in the Poincaré disk, CAT(-1) and hyperbolic spaces==
===Morse–Mostow lemma===
In the case of spaces of negative curvature, such as the Poincaré disk, CAT(-1) and hyperbolic spaces, there is a metric structure on their Gromov boundary. This structure is preserved by the group of quasi-isometries which carry geodesics rays to quasigeodesic rays. Quasigeodesics were first studied for negatively curved surfaces—in particular the hyperbolic upper halfplane and unit disk—by [[Marston Morse|Morse]] and generalised to negatively curved [[symmetric space]]s by [[George Mostow|Mostow]], for his work on the [[Mostow rigidity theorem|rigidity of discrete groups]]. The basic result is the '''Morse–Mostow lemma''' on the stability of geodesics.&lt;ref name="Bourdon 1995"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourdon|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buyalo 2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Buyalo|Schroeder|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mostow|1073}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roe|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By definition a '''[[quasigeodesic]]''' Γ defined on an interval [''a'',''b'']  with −∞  ≤ ''a'' &lt; ''b'' ≤ ∞ is a map Γ(''t'') into a metric space, not necessarily continuous, for which there are constants λ ≥ 1 and ε &gt; 0 such that for all ''s'' and ''t'':

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda^{-1} |s-t| - \varepsilon \le d(\Gamma(s),\Gamma(t)) \le \lambda |s-t| + \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

The following result is essentially due to [[Marston Morse]] (1924).

'''Morse's lemma on stability of geodesics.''' In the hyperbolic disk there is a constant ''R'' depending on λ and ε such that any quasigeodesic segment Γ defined on a finite interval [''a'',''b''] is within a [[Hausdorff distance]] ''R'' of the geodesic segment [Γ(''a''),Γ(''b'')].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buyalo|Schroeder|2007|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bridson|Haefliger|1999|pages=399–405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical proof for Poincaré disk===

The classical proof of Morse's lemma for the Poincaré unit disk or upper halfplane proceeds more directly by using orthogonal projection onto the geodesic segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kapovich|2001|pages=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morse|1924}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ratcliffe|2006|pages=580–599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*It can be assumed that Γ satisfies the stronger "pseudo-geodesic" condition:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kapovich|2001|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\lambda^{-1}|s-t| -\varepsilon \le d(\Gamma(s),\Gamma(t)) \le \lambda |s-t|.&lt;/math&gt;

Γ can be replaced by a continuous piecewise geodesic curve Δ with the same endpoints lying at a finite Hausdorff distance from Γ less than ''c'' = (2λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1)ε: break up the interval on which Γ is defined into equal subintervals of length 2λε and take the geodesics between the images under Γ of the endpoints of the subintervals. Since Δ is piecewise geodesic, Δ is Lipschitz continuous with constant λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''d''(Δ(''s''),Δ(''t'')) ≤ λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|''s'' – ''t''|, where  λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ λ + ε. The lower bound is automatic at the endpoints of intervals. By construction the other values differ from these by a uniformly bounded depending only on λ and ε; the lower bound inequality holds by increasing ε by adding on twice this uniform bound.

*If γ  is a piecewise smooth curve segment lying outside an ''s''-neighbourhood of a geodesic line and ''P'' is the orthogonal projection onto the geodesic line then:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ratcliffe|2006|page=583}}, Lemma 4&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\ell(P \circ \gamma) \le {\ell(\gamma)\over \cosh s}.&lt;/math&gt;

Applying an isometry in the upper half plane, it may be assumed that the geodesic line is the positive imaginary axis in which case the orthogonal projection onto it is given by ''P''(''z'') = ''i''|''z''| and |''z''| / Im z = cosh ''d''(''z'',''Pz''). Hence the hypothesis implies |γ(''t'')| ≥ cosh(''s'') Im γ(''t''), so that

::&lt;math&gt; \ell(P\circ\gamma) =  \int_a^b {|d\gamma|\over |\gamma|} \le \int_a^b {|d\gamma|\over \cosh(s)\, \Im \gamma}={\ell(\gamma)\over \cosh(s)}.&lt;/math&gt;

*There is a constant ''h'' &gt; 0 depending only on λ and ε such that  Γ[''a'',''b''] lies within an ''h''-neighbourhood of the geodesic segment [Γ(''a''),Γ(''b'')].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ratcliffe|2006|pages=584–586}}, Lemmas 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Let γ(''t'') be the geodesic line containing the geodesic segment [Γ(''a''),Γ(''b'')]. Then there is a constant ''h'' &gt; 0 depending only on λ and ε such that  ''h''-neighbourhood Γ[''a'',''b''] lies within an ''h''-neighbourhood of γ('''R'''). Indeed for any ''s'' &gt; 0, the subset of [''a'',''b''] for which Γ(''t'') lies outside the closure of the ''s''-neighbourhood of γ('''R''') is open, so a countable union of open intervals (''c'',''d''). Then

::&lt;math&gt;\ell(\Gamma|_{[c,d]}) \le s_1 \equiv \lambda^2 (2s +\varepsilon) \left(1 -{\lambda^2\over \cosh(s)}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

:since the left hand side is less than or equal to λ|''c'' – ''d''| and

::&lt;math&gt;{|c-d|\over \lambda} -\varepsilon \le d(\Gamma(c),\Gamma(d)) \le 2s + d(P \circ \Gamma|_{[c,d]}) \le 2s + {\lambda |c-d|\over\cosh(s)}.&lt;/math&gt;

:Hence every point lies at a distance less than or equal to ''s'' + ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  of γ('''R'''). To deduce the assertion, note that the subset of [''a'',''b''] for which Γ(''t'') lies outside the closure of the ''s''-neighbourhood of [Γ(''a''),Γ(''b'')] ⊂ γ('''R''') is open, so a union of intervals (''c'',''d'') with Γ(''c'') and Γ(''d'') both at a distance ''s'' + ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; from either Γ(''a'') or Γ(''b''). Then

::&lt;math&gt;\ell(\Gamma|_{[c,d]}) \le s_2 \equiv \lambda^2(2(s + s_1) + \varepsilon),&lt;/math&gt;

:since

::&lt;math&gt;{|c-d|\over \lambda} -\varepsilon \le d(\Gamma(c),\Gamma(d)) \le 2(s+s_1).&lt;/math&gt;

:Hence the assertion follows taking any ''h'' greater than ''s'' +''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

*There is a constant ''h'' &gt; 0 depending only on λ and ε such that the geodesic segment [Γ(''a''),Γ(''b'')] lies within an ''h''-neighbourhood of Γ[''a'',''b''].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kapovich|2001|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every point of Γ[''a'',''b''] lies within a distance ''h'' of [Γ(''a''),Γ(''b'')]. Thus orthogonal projection ''P'' carries each point of Γ[''a'',''b''] onto a point in the closed convex set [Γ(''a''),Γ(''b'')] at a distance less than ''h''. Since ''P'' is continuous and Γ[''a'',''b''] connected, the map ''P'' must be onto since the image contains the endpoints of  [Γ(''a''),Γ(''b'')]. But then every point of [Γ(''a''),Γ(''b'')] is within a distance ''h'' of a point of Γ[''a'',''b''].

===Gromov's proof for Poincaré disk ===
The generalisation of Morse's lemma to CAT(-1) spaces is often referred to as the Morse–Mostow lemma and can be proved by a straightforward generalisation of the classical proof. There is also a generalisation for the more general class of [[hyperbolic metric space]]s due to Gromov. Gromov's proof is given below for the Poincaré unit disk; the properties of hyperbolic metric spaces are developed in the course of the proof, so that it applies [[mutatis mutandi]] to CAT(-1) or hyperbolic metric spaces.&lt;ref name="Bourdon 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buyalo 2007"/&gt;

Since this is a large-scale phenomenon, it is enough to check that any maps Δ from {0, 1, 2, ..., ''N''} for any ''N'' &gt; 0 to the disk satisfying the inequalities is within a Hausdorff distance ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of the geodesic segment [Δ(0),Δ(''N'')]. For then translating it may be assumed without loss of generality Γ is defined on [0,''r''] with ''r'' &gt; 1 and then, taking ''N'' = [''r''] (the integer part of ''r''), the result can be applied to Δ defined by Δ(''i'') = Γ(''i''). The Hausdorff distance between the images of Γ and Δ is evidently bounded by a constant ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; depending only on λ and ε.

:Now the [[incircle]] of a geodesic triangle has diameter less than δ where δ = 2 log 3; indeed it is strictly maximised by that of an ideal triangle where it equals 2 log 3. In particular, since the incircle breaks the triangle breaks the triangle into three isosceles triangles with the third side opposite the vertex of the original triangle having length less than δ, it follows that every side of a geodesic triangle is contained in a δ-neighbourhood of the other two sides. A simple induction argument shows that a geodesic polygon with 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 vertices for ''k'' ≥ 0 has each side within a {{math|1=(''k'' + 1)δ}} neighbourhood of the other sides (such a polygon is made by combining two geodesic polygons with {{math|1=2&lt;sup&gt;''k''−1&lt;/sup&gt; + 1}} sides along a common side). Hence if {{math|1=''M'' ≤ 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; + 2}}, the same estimate holds for a polygon with ''M'' sides.

:For ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = Δ(''i'') let ''f''(''x'') = min ''d''(''x'',''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;), the largest radius for a closed ball centred on ''x'' which contains no ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; in its interior. This is a continuous function non-zero on [Δ(0),Δ(''N'')] so attains its maximum ''h'' at some point ''x'' in this segment. Then [Δ(0),Δ(''N'')] lies within an ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-neighbourhood of the image of Δ for any ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''h''. It therefore suffices to find an upper bound for ''h'' independent of ''N''.

:Choose ''y'' and ''z'' in the segment [Δ(0),Δ(''N'')] before and after ''x'' with ''d''(''x'',''y'') = 2''h'' and ''d''(''x'',''z'') = 2''h'' (or an endpoint if it within a distance of less than 2''h'' from ''x''). Then there are ''i'', ''j'' with ''d''(''y'',Δ(''i'')), ''d''(''z'',Δ(''j'')) ≤ ''h''. Hence ''d''(Δ(''i''),Δ(''j'')) ≤ 6''h'', so that |''i'' − ''j''| ≤ 6λ''h'' + λε. By the triangle inequality all points on the segments [''y'',Δ(''i'')] and [''z'',Δ(''j'')] are at a distance ≥ ''h'' from ''x''. Thus there is a finite sequence of points starting at ''y'' and ending at ''z'', lying first on the segment [''y'',Δ(''i'')], then proceeding through the points Δ(''i''), Δ(''i''+1), ..., Δ(''j''), before taking the segment [Δ(''j''),''z'']. The successive points Δ(''i''), Δ(''i''+1), ..., Δ(''j'') are separated by a distance no greater than λ + ε and successive points on the geodesic segments can also be chosen to satisfy this condition. The minimum number ''K'' of points in such a sequence satisfies ''K'' ≤ |''i'' - ''j''| + 3 + 2(λ + ε)&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;''h''. These points form a geodesic polygon, with [''y'',''z''] as one of the sides. Take ''L'' = [''h''/δ], so that the (''L'' − 1)δ-neighbourhood of [''y'',''z''] does not contain all the other sides of the polygon. Hence, from the result above, it follows that ''K'' &gt; 2&lt;sup&gt;''L'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt; + 2. Hence

:&lt;math&gt;3 + 2(\lambda+\varepsilon)^{-1}h + 6\lambda h + \varepsilon&gt; 2^{h/\delta} + 2.&lt;/math&gt;

:This inequality implies that ''h'' is uniformly bounded, independently of ''N'', as claimed.

:If all points Δ(''i'') lie within ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of the [Δ(0),Δ(''N'')], the result follows. Otherwise the points which do not fall into maximal subsets ''S'' = {''r'', ..., ''s''} with ''r'' &lt; ''s''. Thus points in [Δ(0),Δ(''N'')] have a point  Δ(''i'') with ''i''  in the complement of ''S'' within a distance of ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. But the complement of ''S'' = ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  ∐  ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a disjoint union with ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = {0, ..., ''r'' − 1} and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = {''s'' + 1, ..., ''N''}. [[connected space|Connectivity]] of [Δ(0),Δ(''N'')] implies there is a point ''x'' in the segment which is within a distance ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of points Δ(''i'') and Δ(''j'') with ''i'' &lt; ''r'' and ''j'' &gt; ''s''. But then ''d''(Δ(''i''),Δ(''j'')) &lt; 2 ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, so |''i'' − ''j''| ≤ 2λ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + λε. Hence the points Δ(''k'') for ''k'' in ''S'' lie within a distance from  [Δ(0),Δ(''N'')] of less than ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + λ|''i'' − ''j''| + ε ≤ ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + λ (2λ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + λε) + ε ≡ ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Extension to quasigeodesic rays and lines===
Recall that in a Hadamard space if [''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;] and [''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] are two geodesic segments and the intermediate points ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') divide them in the ratio ''t'':(1 – ''t''), then ''d''(''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''),''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')) is a convex function of ''t''. In particular if Γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') and  Γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') are geodesic segments of unit speed defined on [0,''R''] starting at the same point then

:&lt;math&gt;d(\Gamma_1(t),\Gamma_2(t)) \le {t\over R} d(\Gamma_1(R),\Gamma_2(R)).&lt;/math&gt;

In particular this implies the following:

*'''''In a CAT(–1) space ''X'', there is a constant  h &gt; 0 depending only on λ and ε such that any quasi-geodesic ray is within a bounded Hausdorff distance h of a geodesic ray. A similar result holds for quasigeodesic and geodesic lines.'''''

If Γ(''t'') is a geodesic say with constant λ and ε, let Γ&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') be the unit speed geodesic for the segment [Γ(0),Γ(''N'')]. The estimate above shows that for fixed ''R'' &gt; 0 and ''N'' sufficiently large, (Γ&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a Cauchy sequence in ''C''([0,''R''],''X'') with the uniform metric. Thus Γ&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; tends to a geodesic ray γ uniformly on compacta the bound on the Hausdorff distances between Γ and the segments Γ&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; applies also to the limiting geodesic γ. The assertion for quasigeodesic lines follows by taking Γ&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; corresponding to the geodesic segment [Γ(–''N''),Γ(''N'')].

== Efremovich–Tikhomirova theorem ==
Before discussing CAT(-1) spaces, this section will describe the '''Efremovich–Tikhomirova theorem''' for the unit disk ''D'' with the Poincaré metric. It asserts that quasi-isometries of ''D'' extend to quasi-Möbius homeomorphisms of the unit disk with the Euclidean metric. The theorem forms the prototype for the more general theory of CAT(-1) spaces. Their original theorem was proved in a slightly less general and less precise form in {{harvtxt|Efremovich|Tikhomirova|1964}} and applied to bi-Lipschitz homeomorphisms of the unit disk for the Poincaré metric;&lt;ref&gt;Bi-Lipschitz homeomorphisms are those for which they and their inverses are Lipschitz continuous&lt;/ref&gt; earlier, in the posthumous paper {{harvtxt|Mori|1957}}, the Japanese mathematician Akira Mori had proved a related result within [[Teichmüller theory]] assuring that every [[quasiconformal mapping|quasiconformal homeomorphism]] of the disk is [[Hölder continuous]] and therefore extends continuously to a homeomorphism of the unit circle (it is known that this extension is quasi-Möbius).&lt;ref&gt;See:

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extension of quasi-isometries to boundary ===
If ''X'' is the Poincaré unit disk, or more generally a CAT(-1) space, the Morse lemma on stability of quasigeodesics implies that every quasi-isometry of ''X'' extends uniquely to the boundary. By definition two self-mappings ''f'', ''g'' of ''X'' are quasi-equivalent if sup&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''d''(''f''(''x''),''g''(''x'')) &lt; ∞, so that corresponding points are at a uniformly bounded distance of each other. A quasi-isometry ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of ''X'' is a self-mapping of ''X'', not necessarily continuous, which has a quasi-inverse ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are quasi-equivalent to the appropriate identity maps and such that there are constants λ ≥ 1 and ε &gt; 0 such that for all ''x'', ''y'' in ''X'' and both mappings

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda^{-1} d(x,y) - \varepsilon \le d(f_k(x),f_k(y)) \le \lambda d(x,y) +\varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that quasi-inverses are unique up to quasi-equivalence; that equivalent definition could be given using possibly different right and left-quasi inverses, but they would necessarily be quasi-equivalent; that quasi-isometries are closed under composition which up to quasi-equivalence depends only the quasi-equivalence classes; and that, modulo quasi-equivalence, the quasi-isometries form a group.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Bourdon|1995}}
*{{harvnb|Bridson|Haefliger|1999}}

*{{harvnb|Bourdon|2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Fixing a point ''x'' in ''X'', given a geodesic ray γ starting at ''x'', the image ''f'' ∘ γ under a quasi-isometry ''f'' is a quasi-geodesic ray. By the Morse-Mostow lemma it is within a bounded distance of a unique geodesic ray δ starting at ''x''. This defines a mapping ∂''f'' on the boundary ∂''X'' of ''X'', independent of the quasi-equivalence class of ''f'', such that ∂(''f'' ∘ ''g'') = ∂''f'' ∘ ∂''g''. Thus there is a homomorphism of the group of quasi-isometries into the group of self-mappings of  ∂''X''.

To check that ∂''f'' is continuous, note that if γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are geodesic rays that are uniformly close on [0,''R''],  within a distance η, then ''f'' ∘ γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''f'' ∘ γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lie within a distance λη + ε  on [0,''R''], so that δ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and δ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lie within a distance λη + ε + 2''h''(λ,ε); hence on a smaller interval [0,''r''], δ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and δ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lie within a distance (''r''/''R'')⋅[λη + ε + 2''h''(λ,ε)] by convexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bridson|Haefliger|1999|pages=430–431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On CAT(-1) spaces, a finer version of continuity asserts that ∂''f'' is a quasi-Möbius mapping with respect to a natural class of metric on ∂''X'', the "visual metrics" generalising the Euclidean metric on the unit circle and its transforms under the Möbius group. These visual metrics can be defined in terms of Busemann functions.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Bourdon|1995}}
*{{harvnb|Buyalo|Schroeder|2007}}
*{{harvnb|Bourdon|2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of the unit disk, Teichmüller theory implies that the homomorphism carries quasiconformal homeomorphisms of the disk onto the group of quasi-Möbius homeomorphisms of the circle (using for example the Ahlfors–Beurling or [[Douady–Earle extension]]): it follows that the homomorphism from the quasi-isometry group into the quasi-Möbius group is surjective.

In the other direction, it is straightforward to prove that the homomorphism is injective.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roe|2003|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suppose that ''f'' is a quasi-isometry of the unit disk such that ∂''f'' is the identity. The assumption and the Morse lemma implies that if γ('''R''') is a geodesic line, then ''f''(γ('''R''')) lies in an ''h''-neighbourhood of γ('''R'''). Now take a second geodesic line δ such that δ and γ intersect orthogonally at a given point in ''a''. Then ''f''(''a'') lies in the intersection of ''h''-neighbourhoods of δ and γ. Applying a Möbius transformation, it can be assumed that ''a'' is at the origin of the unit disk and the geodesics are the real and imaginary axes. By convexity, the ''h''-neighbourhoods of these axes intersect in a 3''h''-neighbourhood of the origin: if ''z'' lies in both neighbourhoods, let ''x'' and ''y'' be the orthogonal projections of ''z''  onto the ''x''- and ''y''-axes; then {{math|1=''d''(''z'',''x'') ≤ ''h''}} so taking projections onto the ''y''-axis, {{math|1=''d''(0,''y'') ≤ ''h''}}; hence  {{math|1=''d''(''z'',0) ≤ ''d''(''z'',''y'') + ''d''(''y'',0) ≤ 2''h''}}.  Hence {{math|1=''d''(''a'',''f''(''a'')) ≤ 2''h''}}, so that ''f'' is quasi-equivalent to the identity, as claimed.

===Cross ratio and distance between non-intersecting geodesic lines===
Given two distinct points ''z'', ''w'' on the unit circle or real axis there is a unique hyperbolic geodesic [''z'',''w''] joining them. It is given by the circle (or straight line) which cuts the unit circle unit circle or real axis orthogonally at those two points. Given four distinct points ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' in the extended complex plane their [[cross ratio]] is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;(a,b;c,d) ={(a-c)(b-d)\over (a-d)(b-c)}.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''g'' is a complex [[Möbius transformation]] then it leaves the cross ratio invariant: {{math|1=(''g''(''a''),''g''(''b'');''g''(''c''),''g''(''d'')) = (''a'',''b'':''c'',''d'')}}. Since the Möbius group acts simply transitively on triples of points, the cross ratio can alternatively be described as the complex number ''z'' in '''C'''\{0,1} such that ''g''(''a'') = 0, ''g''(''b'') = 1, ''g''(''c'') = λ, ''g''(''d'') = ∞ for a Möbius transformation ''g''.

Since ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and ''d'' all appear in the numerator defining the cross ratio, to understand the behaviour of the cross ratio under permutations of ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and ''d'', it suffices to consider permutations that fix ''d'', so only permute ''a'', ''b'' and ''c''. The cross ratio transforms according to the [[anharmonic group]] of order 6 generated by the Möbius transformations sending λ to 1 – λ and λ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The other three transformations send λ to 1 – λ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, to λ(λ – 1)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and to (1 – λ)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beardon|1983|pages=75–78}} Note that there is a natural homomorphism of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, acting by conjugation on (''a'',''b'')(''c'',''d''), (''a'',''c'')(''b'',''d'') and (''a'',''d'')(''b'',''c''). Indeed these permutations together with the identty form a normal Abelian subgroup equal to its own centraliser: the action of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; by conjugation on the non-trivial elements yields the homomorphism onto ''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Now let ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' be points on the unit circle or real axis in that order. Then the geodesics [''a'',''b''] and [''c'',''d''] do not intersect and the distance between these geodesics is well defined: there is a unique geodesic line cutting these two geodesics orthogonally and the distance is given by the length of the geodesic segment between them. It is evidently invariant under real Möbius transformations. To compare the cross ratio and the distance between geodesics, Möbius invariance allows the calculation to be reduced to a symmetric configuration. For 0 &lt; ''r'' &lt; ''R'', take ''a'' = –''R'', ''b'' = −''r'', ''c'' = ''r'', ''d'' = ''R''. Then
{{math|1=λ = (''a'',''b'';''c'',''d'') = (''R'' + ''r'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/4''rR'' =  (''t'' + 1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/4''t''}} where ''t'' = ''R''/''r'' &gt; 1. On the other hand, the geodesics [''a'',''d''] and [''b'',''c''] are the semicircles in the upper half plane of radius ''r'' and ''R''. The geodesic which cuts them orthogonally is the positive imaginary axis, so the distance between them is the hyperbolic distance between ''ir'' and ''iR'', ''d''(''ir'',''iR'') = log ''R''/''r'' = log ''t''. Let ''s'' = log ''t'', then λ = cosh&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''s''/2), so that there is a constant ''C'' &gt; 0 such that, if (''a'',''b'';''c'',''d'') &gt; 1, then

:&lt;math&gt;d([a,d];[b,c]) - C \le \log (a,b;c,d) \le d([a,d];[b,c]) + C,&lt;/math&gt;

since log[cosh(''x'')/exp''x'')] = log (1 + exp(–2''x''))/2 is bounded above and below in ''x'' ≥ 0. Note that ''a'', ''b'',''c'', ''d'' are in order around the unit circle if and only if (''a'',''b'';''c'',''d'') &gt; 1.

A more general and precise geometric interpretation of the cross ratio can be given using projections of ideal points on to a geodesic line; it does not depend on the order of the points on the circle and therefore whether or not geodesic lines intersect.&lt;ref&gt;See: 
*{{harvnb|Paulin|1996}}
*{{harvnb|Bulayo|Schroeder|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''If p and q are the feet of the perpendiculars from c and d to the geodesic line ab, then d(p,q) = |log |(a,b;c,d)||.'''''

Since both sides are invariant under Möbius transformations, it suffices to check this in the case that ''a'' = 0, ''b'' = ∞, ''c'' = ''x'' and ''d'' = 1. In this case the geodesic line is the positive imaginary axis, right hand side equals |log |''x''||, ''p'' = |''x''|''i'' and ''q'' = ''i''. So the left hand side equals |log|''x''||. Note that ''p'' and ''q'' are also the points where the incircles of the ideal triangles ''abc'' and ''abd'' touch ''ab''.

===Proof of theorem===
A homeomorphism ''F'' of the circle is [[quasisymmetric map|''quasisymmetric'']] if there are constants ''a'', ''b'' &gt; 0 such that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{{|F(z_1)-F(z_2)|\over |F(z_1)-F(z_3)|} \le a {|z_1-z_2|^b\over |z_1-z_3|^b}.}&lt;/math&gt;

It is ''quasi-Möbius'' is there are constants ''c'', ''d'' &gt; 0 such that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{|(F(z_1),F(z_2);F(z_3),F(z_4))| \le c |(z_1,z_2;z_3,z_4)|^d,}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{ (z_1,z_2;z_3,z_4)={(z_1-z_3)(z_2-z_4)\over(z_2-z_3)(z_1-z_4)}}&lt;/math&gt;

denotes the [[cross-ratio]].

It is immediate that quasisymmetric and quasi-Möbius homeomorphisms are closed under the operations of inversion and composition.

If ''F'' is quasisymmetric then it is also quasi-Möbius, with ''c'' = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''d'' = ''b'': this follows by multiplying the first inequality for (''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''z''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,''z''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''z''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;,''z''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Conversely any quasi-Möbius homeomorphism ''F'' is quasisymmetric. To see this, it can be first be checked that ''F'' (and hence ''F''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) is [[Hölder continuous]]. Let ''S'' be the set of cube roots of unity, so that if ''a'' ≠ ''b'' in ''S'', then |''a'' − ''b''| = 2 sin {{pi}}/3 = {{radic|3}}. To prove a Hölder estimate, it can be assumed that ''x'' – ''y'' is uniformly small. Then both ''x'' and ''y'' are greater than a fixed distance away from ''a'', ''b'' in ''S'' with ''a'' ≠ ''b'', so the estimate follows by applying the quasi-Möbius inequality to ''x'', ''a'', ''y'', ''b''. To verify that ''F'' is quasisymmetric, it suffices to find a uniform upper bound for |''F''(''x'') − ''F''(''y'')| / |''F''(''x'') − ''F''(''z'')| in the case of a triple with |''x'' − ''z''| = |''x'' − ''y''|, uniformly small. In this case there is a point ''w'' at a distance greater than 1 from ''x'', ''y'' and ''z''. Applying the quasi-Möbius inequality to ''x'', ''w'', ''y'' and ''z'' yields the required upper bound. To summarise:

* '''''A homeomorphism of the circle is quasi-Möbius if and only if it is quasisymmetric. In this case it and its inverse are Hölder continuous. The quasi-Möbius homeomorphisms form a group under composition.'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Väisälä|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To prove the theorem it suffices to prove that if ''F'' = ∂''f'' then there are constants ''A'', ''B'' &gt; 0 such that for ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' distinct points on the unit circle&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourdon|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{|(F(a),F(b);F(c),F(d))| \le A |(a,b;c,d)|^B.}&lt;/math&gt;

It has already been checked that ''F'' (and is inverse) are continuous. Composing ''f'', and hence ''F'', with complex conjugation if necessary, it can further be assumed that ''F'' preserves the orientation of the circle. In this case, if ''a'',''b'', ''c'',''d'' are in order on the circle, so too are there images under ''F''; hence both (''a'',''b'';''c'',''d'') and (''F''(''a''),''F''(''b'');''F''(''c''),''F''(''d'')) are real and greater than one. In this case

:&lt;math&gt;(F(a),F(b);F(c),F(d)) \le A (a,b;c,d)^B.&lt;/math&gt;

To prove this, it suffices to show that {{math|1=log (''F''(''a''),''F''(''b'');''F''(''c''),''F''(''d'')) ≤ ''B'' log (''a'',''b'';''c'',''d'') + ''C''}}. From the previous section it suffices show {{math|1=''d''([''F''(''a''),''F''(''b'')],[''F''(''c''),''F''(''d'')]) ≤ ''P'' ''d''([''a'',''b''],[''c'',''d'']) + ''Q''}}. This follows from the fact that the images under ''f'' of [''a'',''b''] and [''c'',''d''] lie within ''h''-neighbourhoods of [''F''(''a''),''F''(''b'')] and [''F''(''c''),''F''(''d'')]; the minimal distance can be estimated using the quasi-isometry constants for ''f'' applied to the points on [''a'',''b''] and [''c'',''d'']
realising ''d''([''a'',''b''],[''c'',''d'']).

Adjusting ''A'' and ''B'' if necessary, the inequality above applies also to ''F''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Replacing ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and ''d'' by their images under ''F'', it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;A^{-1} |(a,b;c,d)|^{-B} \le |(F(a),F(b);F(c),F(d))| \le A |(a,b;c,d)|^B&lt;/math&gt;

if ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and ''d'' are in order on the unit circle. Hence the same inequalities are valid for the three cyclic of the quadruple ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d''. If ''a'' and ''b'' are switched then the cross ratios are sent to their inverses, so lie between 0 and 1; similarly if ''c'' and ''d'' are switched. If both pairs are switched, the cross ratio remains unaltered.  Hence the inequalities are also valid in this case. Finally if ''b'' and ''c'' are interchanged, the cross ratio changes from λ to {{math|1=λ&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;
(λ – 1) = 1 – λ&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which lies between 0 and 1. Hence again the same inequalities are valid. It is easy to check that using these transformations the inequalities are valid for all possible permutations of ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and ''d'', so that ''F'' and its inverse are quasi-Möbius homeomorphisms.

== Busemann functions and visual metrics for CAT(-1) spaces==

Busemann functions can be used to determine special visual metrics on the class of CAT(-1) spaces. These are complete geodesic metric spaces in which the distances between points on the boundary of a geodesic triangle are less than or equal to the comparison triangle in the hyperbolic upper half plane or equivalently the unit disk with the Poincaré metric. In the case of the unit disk the chordal metric can be recovered directly using Busemann functions ''B''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt; and the special theory for the disk generalises completely to any proper CAT(-1) space ''X''. The hyperbolic upper half plane is a CAT(0) space, as lengths in a hyperbolic geodesic triangle are less than lengths in the Euclidean comparison triangle: in particular a CAT(-1) space is a CAT(0) space, so the theory of Busemann functions and the Gromov boundary applies. From the theory of the hyperbolic disk, it follows in particular that every geodesic ray in a CAT(-1) space extends to a geodesic line and given two points of the boundary there is a unique geodesic γ such that has these points as the limits γ(±∞). The theory applies equally well to any CAT(−κ) space with κ &gt; 0 since these arise by scaling the metric on a CAT(-1) space by κ&lt;sup&gt;−1/2&lt;/sup&gt;. On the hyperbolic unit disk ''D'' quasi-isometries of ''D'' induce quasi-Möbius homeomorphisms of the boundary in a functorial way. There is a more general theory of Gromov hyperbolic spaces, a similar statement holds, but with less precise control on the homeomorphisms of the boundary.&lt;ref name="Bourdon 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buyalo 2007"/&gt;

      <text bytes="6777" xml:space="preserve">In [[Euclidean geometry]], '''linear separability''' is a property of two sets of [[point (geometry)|points]]. This is most easily visualized in two dimensions (the [[Euclidean plane]]) by thinking of one set of points as being colored blue and the other set of points as being colored red. These two sets are ''linearly separable'' if there exists at least one [[line (geometry)|line]] in the plane with all of the blue points on one side of the line and all the red points on the other side. This idea immediately generalizes to higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces if the line is replaced by a [[hyperplane]].

The problem of determining if a pair of sets is linearly separable and finding a separating hyperplane if they are, arises in several areas.  In [[statistics]] and [[machine learning]], classifying certain types of data is a problem for which good algorithms exist that are based on this concept.

==Mathematical definition==

Let &lt;math&gt;X_{0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_{1}&lt;/math&gt; be two sets of points in an ''n''-dimensional Euclidean space. Then &lt;math&gt;X_{0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_{1}&lt;/math&gt; are ''linearly separable'' if there exist ''n'' + 1 real numbers &lt;math&gt;w_{1}, w_{2},..,w_{n}, k&lt;/math&gt;, such that every point &lt;math&gt;x \in X_{0}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\sum^{n}_{i=1} w_{i}x_{i} &gt; k&lt;/math&gt; and every point &lt;math&gt;x \in X_{1}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\sum^{n}_{i=1} w_{i}x_{i} &lt; k&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x_{i}&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th component of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

Equivalently, two sets are linearly separable precisely when their respective [[convex hull]]s are [[disjoint sets|disjoint]] (colloquially, do not overlap).{{Citation needed|reason=It is unclear that this is equivalent|date=September 2017}}

== Examples ==

Three non-[[collinear]] points in two classes ('+' and '-') are always linearly separable in two dimensions. This is illustrated by the three examples in the following figure (the all '+' case is not shown, but is similar to the all '-' case):

{| align="center" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="10"
| align="center" | [[File:VC1.svg]]
| align="center" | [[File:VC2.svg]]
| align="center" | [[File:VC3.svg]]
|}

However, not all sets of four points, no three collinear, are linearly separable in two dimensions. The following example would need ''two'' straight lines and thus is not linearly separable:

{| align="center" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0"
| [[File:VC4.svg]]
|}

Notice that three points which are collinear and of the form "+ ⋅⋅⋅ &amp;mdash; ⋅⋅⋅ +" are also not linearly separable.

== Linear separability of Boolean functions in ''n'' variables ==

A [[Boolean function]] in ''n'' variables can be thought of as an assignment of ''0'' or ''1'' to each vertex of a Boolean [[hypercube]] in ''n'' dimensions. This gives a natural division of the vertices into two sets. The Boolean function is said to be ''linearly separable'' provided these two sets of points are linearly separable. The number of distinct Boolean functions is &lt;math&gt;2^{2^{n}}&lt;/math&gt;where ''n'' is the number of variables passed into the function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Artificial intelligence a modern approach|last=1962-|first=Russell, Stuart J.|publisher=|others=Norvig, Peter 1956-|year=2016|isbn=978-1292153964|edition= Third|location=Boston|pages=766|oclc=945899984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support vector machines==

[[Image:Svm separating hyperplanes (SVG).svg|thumb|right|H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; does not separate the sets. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; does, but only with a small margin.  H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; separates them with the maximum margin.]]
[[Statistical classification|Classifying data]] is a common task in [[machine learning]].
Suppose some data points, each belonging to one of two sets, are given and we wish to create a model that will decide which set a ''new'' data point will be in. In the case of [[support vector machine]]s, a data point is viewed as a ''p''-dimensional vector (a list of ''p'' numbers), and we want to know whether we can separate such points with a (''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional [[hyperplane]]. This is called a [[linear classifier]]. There are many hyperplanes that might classify (separate) the data. One reasonable choice as the best hyperplane is the one that represents the largest separation, or margin, between the two sets. So we choose the hyperplane so that the distance from it to the nearest data point on each side is maximized. If such a hyperplane exists, it is known as the ''[[maximum-margin hyperplane]]'' and the linear classifier it defines is known as a ''maximum [[margin classifier]]''.

More formally, given some training data &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, a set of ''n'' points of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D} = \left\{ (\mathbf{x}_i, y_i)\mid\mathbf{x}_i \in \mathbb{R}^p,\, y_i \in \{-1,1\}\right\}_{i=1}^n&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is either 1 or −1, indicating the set to which the point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_i &lt;/math&gt; belongs. Each &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_i &lt;/math&gt; is a ''p''-dimensional [[real number|real]] vector. We want to find the maximum-margin hyperplane that divides the points having &lt;math&gt;y_i=1&lt;/math&gt; from those having &lt;math&gt;y_i=-1&lt;/math&gt;. Any hyperplane can be written as the set of points &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x} - b=0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[dot product]] and &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{w}}&lt;/math&gt; the (not necessarily normalized) [[Normal (geometry)|normal vector]] to the hyperplane. The parameter &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{b}{\|\mathbf{w}\|}&lt;/math&gt; determines the offset of the hyperplane from the origin along the normal vector &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{w}}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the training data are linearly separable, we can select two hyperplanes in such a way that they separate the data and there are no points between them, and then try to maximize their distance.

[[Image:Hyperbolic orthogonal dodecahedral honeycomb.png|thumb|A perspective projection of a [[Hyperbolic small dodecahedral honeycomb|dodecahedral tessellation]] in '''[[Hyperbolic 3-manifold|H&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]]'''. Note the recursive structure: each pentagon contains smaller pentagons, which contain smaller pentagons. This is an example of a subdivision rule arising from a finite universe (i.e. a [[closed manifold|closed]] [[3-manifold]]).]]

In mathematics, a '''finite subdivision rule''' is a recursive way of dividing a [[polygon]] or other two-dimensional shape into smaller and smaller pieces. Subdivision rules in a sense are generalizations of regular geometric [[fractals]]. Instead of repeating exactly the same design over and over, they have slight variations in each stage, allowing a richer structure while maintaining the elegant style of fractals.&lt;ref name="finite" /&gt; Subdivision rules have been used in architecture, biology, and computer science, as well as in the study of [[hyperbolic manifold]]s. [[Substitution tiling]]s are a well-studied type of subdivision rule.

==Definition==
A subdivision rule takes a [[Tiling (mathematics)|tiling]] of the plane by polygons and turns it into a new tiling by subdividing''' '''each polygon into smaller polygons. It is '''finite '''if there are only finitely many ways that every polygon can subdivide. Each way of subdividing a tile is called a '''tile type'''. Each tile type is represented by a label (usually a letter). Every tile type subdivides into smaller tile types. Each edge also gets subdivided according to finitely many '''edge types'''. Finite subdivision rules can only subdivide tilings that are made up of polygons labelled by tile types. Such tilings are called '''subdivision complexes''' for the subdivision rule. Given any subdivision complex for a subdivision rule, we can subdivide it over and over again to get a sequence of tilings.

For instance, '''binary subdivision''' has one tile type and one edge type:
[[File:The binary subdivision rule.png|frameless|none|The binary subdivision rule]]

Since the only tile type is a quadrilateral, binary subdivision can only subdivide tilings made up of quadrilaterals. This means that the only subdivision complexes are tilings by quadrilaterals. The tiling can be [[Regular tiling|regular]], but doesn't have to be:

[[File:BinarySubdivisionComplex2.png|frameless|none|We start with a complex with four quadrilaterals and subdivide twice. All squares are type A tiles.]]

Here we start with a complex made of four quadrilaterals and subdivide it twice. All quadrilaterals are type A tiles.

==Examples of finite subdivision rules==

[[Barycentric subdivision]] is an example of a subdivision rule with one edge type (that gets subdivided into two edges) and one tile type (a triangle that gets subdivided into 6 smaller triangles). Any triangulated surface is a barycentric subdivision complex.&lt;ref name="finite"&gt;J. W. Cannon, W. J. Floyd, W. R. Parry. ''[http://www.ams.org/ecgd/2001-05-08/S1088-4173-01-00055-8/S1088-4173-01-00055-8.pdf Finite subdivision rules]''. Conformal Geometry and Dynamics, vol. 5 (2001), pp. 153&amp;ndash;196.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Penrose tiling]] can be generated by a subdivision rule on a set of four tile types (the curved lines in the table below only help to show how the tiles fit together):

Certain [[rational mapping|rational maps]] give rise to finite subdivision rules.&lt;ref name="rational"&gt;J. W. Cannon, W. J. Floyd, W. R. Parry. ''[https://www.ams.org/ecgd/2007-11-10/S1088-4173-07-00167-1/S1088-4173-07-00167-1.pdf Constructing subdivision rules from rational maps]''. Conformal Geometry and Dynamics, vol. 11 (2007), pp. 128&amp;ndash;136.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes most [[Lattès map]]s.&lt;ref name="rationalB"&gt;J. W. Cannon, W. J. Floyd, W. R. Parry. ''Lattès maps and subdivision rules''. Conformal Geometry and Dynamics, vol. 14 (2010, pp. 113&amp;ndash;140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Every prime, non-split alternating [[knot complement|knot or link complement]] has a subdivision rule, with some tiles that do not subdivide, corresponding to the boundary of the link complement.&lt;ref name="Alternating"&gt;B. Rushton. ''[http://www.ams.org/journals/ecgd/2010-14-01/S1088-4173-09-00205-7/S1088-4173-09-00205-7.pdf Constructing subdivision rules from alternating links]''. Conform. Geom. Dyn. 14 (2010), 1&amp;ndash;13.&lt;/ref&gt; The subdivision rules show what the night sky would look like to someone living in a [[knot complement]]; because the universe wraps around itself (i.e. is not [[simply connected]]), an observer would see the visible universe repeat itself in an infinite pattern. The subdivision rule describes that pattern.

The subdivision rule looks different for different geometries. This is a subdivision rule for the [[trefoil knot]], which is not a [[hyperbolic knot]]:

[[File:Trefoil subdivision rule.png|none|300px|Trefoil subdivision rule]]
	 	
And this is the subdivision rule for the [[Borromean rings]], which is hyperbolic:
	 
[[File:Borromean subdivision rule.png|none|300px|Borromean subdivision rule]] 
	
In each case, the subdivision rule would act on some tiling of a sphere (i.e. the night sky), but it is easier to just draw a small part of the night sky, corresponding to a single tile being repeatedly subdivided. This is what happens for the trefoil knot:
	
[[File:Finite subdivisions for the trefoil knot complement.png|300px|none|Subdivisions of the subdivision complex for the trefoil complement.]]
		
And for the Borromean rings:	 
	
[[File:Finite subdivisions for the Borromean rings complement.png|300px|none|Subdivisions of the subdivision complex for the Borromean rings complement.]]

==Subdivision rules in higher dimensions==

Subdivision rules can easily be generalized to other dimensions.&lt;ref name="Torus"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rushton | first1 = B. | doi = 10.1007/s10711-012-9802-5 | title = A finite subdivision rule for the n-dimensional torus | journal = Geometriae Dedicata | volume = 167 | pages = 23–34 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = | arxiv = 1110.3310 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[barycentric subdivision]] is used in all dimensions. Also, binary subdivision can be generalized to other dimensions (where [[hypercube]]s get divided by every midplane), as in the proof of the [[Heine–Borel theorem]].

==Rigorous definition==
[[File:FourTorusSubdivision.svg|thumb|A subdivision rule for the four-torus. The faces of the B tiles that subdivide can only touch C tiles, and the faces of the B tiles that don't only touch A tiles.]]
A '''finite subdivision rule''' &lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt; consists of the following.&lt;ref name="finite" /&gt;

1. A finite 2-dimensional [[CW complex]] &lt;math&gt;S_R&lt;/math&gt;, called the '''subdivision complex''', with a fixed cell structure such that &lt;math&gt;S_R&lt;/math&gt; is the union of its closed 2-cells. We assume that for each closed 2-cell &lt;math&gt;\tilde{s}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;S_R&lt;/math&gt; there is a CW structure &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; on a closed 2-disk such that &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; has at least two vertices, the vertices and edges of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; are contained in &lt;math&gt;\partial s&lt;/math&gt;, and the characteristic map &lt;math&gt;\psi_s:s\rightarrow S_R&lt;/math&gt; which maps onto &lt;math&gt;\tilde{s}&lt;/math&gt; restricts to a homeomorphism onto each open cell.

2. A finite two dimensional CW complex &lt;math&gt;R(S_R)&lt;/math&gt;, which is a subdivision of &lt;math&gt;S_R&lt;/math&gt;.

3.A continuous cellular map &lt;math&gt;\phi_R:R(S_R)\rightarrow S_R&lt;/math&gt; called the '''subdivision map''', whose restriction to every open cell is a homeomorphism onto an open cell.

Each CW complex &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; in the definition above (with its given characteristic map &lt;math&gt;\psi_s&lt;/math&gt;) is called a '''tile type'''.

An &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-complex for a subdivision rule &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a 2-dimensional CW complex &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; which is the union of its closed 2-cells, together with a continuous cellular map &lt;math&gt;f:X\rightarrow S_R&lt;/math&gt; whose restriction to each open cell is a homeomorphism. We can subdivide &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; into a complex &lt;math&gt;R(X)&lt;/math&gt; by requiring that the induced map &lt;math&gt;f:R(X)\rightarrow R(S_R)&lt;/math&gt; restricts to a homeomorphism onto each open cell. &lt;math&gt;R(X)&lt;/math&gt; is again an &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-complex with map &lt;math&gt;\phi_R \circ f:R(X)\rightarrow S_R&lt;/math&gt;. By repeating this process, we obtain a sequence of subdivided &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-complexes &lt;math&gt;R^n(X)&lt;/math&gt; with maps &lt;math&gt;\phi_R^n\circ f:R^n(X)\rightarrow S_R&lt;/math&gt;.

Binary subdivision is one example:&lt;ref name="biol"/&gt;

[[File:The binary subdivision rule.png|frameless|none|The binary subdivision rule.]]

The subdivision complex can be created by gluing together the opposite edges of the square, making the subdivision complex &lt;math&gt;S_R&lt;/math&gt; into a [[torus]]. The subdivision map &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the doubling map on the torus, wrapping the meridian around itself twice and the longitude around itself twice. This is a four-fold [[covering map]]. The plane, tiled by squares, is a subdivision complex for this subdivision rule, with the structure map &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow R(S_R)&lt;/math&gt; given by the standard covering map. Under subdivision, each square in the plane gets subdivided into squares of one-fourth the size.

==Quasi-isometry properties==
[[File:CantorHistoryGraph.png|thumb|The history graph of the [[Cantor set|middle thirds]] subdivision rule.]]

Subdivision rules can be used to study the [[quasi-isometry]] properties of certain spaces.&lt;ref name="RM"/&gt; Given a subdivision rule &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and subdivision complex &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, we can construct a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] called the '''history graph''' that records the action of the subdivision rule. The graph consists of the [[dual graph]]s of every stage &lt;math&gt;R^n(X)&lt;/math&gt;, together with edges connecting each tile in &lt;math&gt;R^n(X)&lt;/math&gt; with its subdivisions in &lt;math&gt;R^{n+1}(X)&lt;/math&gt;.

The quasi-isometry properties of the history graph can be studied using subdivision rules. For instance, the history graph is quasi-isometric to [[hyperbolic space]] exactly when the subdivision rule is '''conformal''', as described in the [[combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem]].&lt;ref name = "RM" /&gt;

[[Subdivision surface]]s in computer graphics use subdivision rules to refine a surface to any given level of precision. These subdivision surfaces (such as the [[Catmull-Clark subdivision surface]]) take a [[polygon mesh]] (the kind used in 3D animated movies) and refines it to a mesh with more polygons by adding and shifting points according to different recursive formulas.&lt;ref name="surface"&gt;D. Zorin. ''[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.370.2714&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Subdivisions on arbitrary meshes: algorithms and theory]''. Institute of Mathematical Sciences (Singapore) Lecture Notes Series. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Although many points get shifted in this process, each new mesh is combinatorially a subdivision of the old mesh (meaning that for every edge and vertex of the old mesh, you can identify a corresponding edge and vertex in the new one, plus several more edges and vertices).

Subdivision rules were applied by Cannon, Floyd and Parry (2000) to the study of large-scale growth patterns of biological organisms.&lt;ref name="biol"&gt;J. W. Cannon, W. Floyd and W. Parry. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qZHyqUli9y8C&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=%22james+w.+cannon%22+maths&amp;source=web&amp;ots=RP1svsBqga&amp;sig=kxyEXFBqOG5NnJncng9HHniHyrc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA65,M1 ''Crystal growth, biological cell growth and geometry''.] Pattern Formation in Biology, Vision and Dynamics, pp. 65&amp;ndash;82.

==Cannon's conjecture==

[[James W. Cannon|Cannon]], [[William Floyd (mathematician)|Floyd]], and [[Walter Parry|Parry]] first studied finite subdivision rules in an attempt to prove the following conjecture:

'''Cannon's conjecture''': Every [[Mikhail Leonidovich Gromov|Gromov]] [[hyperbolic group]] with a 2-sphere at infinity [[Geometric group action|acts geometrically]] on [[hyperbolic space|hyperbolic 3-space]].&lt;ref name="RM"&gt;James W. Cannon. [https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF02398434 ''The combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem''.] [[Acta Mathematica]] 173 (1994), no. 2, pp. 155&amp;ndash;234.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here, a geometric action is a cocompact, properly discontinuous action by isometries. This conjecture was partially solved by [[Grigori Perelman]] in his proof&lt;ref name="perelman200211"&gt;{{cite arXiv|author=Perelman, Grisha |title=The entropy formula for the Ricci flow and its geometric applications |eprint = math.DG/0211159 | date = 11 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="perelman200303"&gt;{{cite arXiv|author=Perelman, Grisha|title=Ricci flow with surgery on three-manifolds |eprint=math.DG/0303109 | date = 10 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="perelman200307"&gt;{{cite arXiv|author=Perelman, Grisha|title=Finite extinction time for the solutions to the Ricci flow on certain three-manifolds |eprint=math.DG/0307245 |date = 17 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[geometrization conjecture]], which states (in part) than any Gromov hyperbolic group that is a 3-manifold group must act geometrically on hyperbolic 3-space. However, it still remains to show that a Gromov hyperbolic group with a 2-sphere at infinity is a 3-manifold group.

Cannon and Swenson showed &lt;ref name="CS"&gt;J. W. Cannon and E. L. Swenson, ''Recognizing constant curvature discrete groups in dimension 3''. [[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]] 350 (1998), no. 2, pp. 809&amp;ndash;849.&lt;/ref&gt; that a hyperbolic group with a 2-sphere at infinity has an associated subdivision rule. If this subdivision rule is conformal in a certain sense, the group will be a 3-manifold group with the geometry of hyperbolic 3-space.&lt;ref name="RM" /&gt;

==Combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem==

Subdivision rules give a sequence of tilings of a surface, and tilings give an idea of distance, length, and area (by letting each tile have length and area 1). In the limit, the distances that come from these tilings may converge in some sense to an [[Riemann surface|analytic structure]] on the surface. The Combinatorial Riemann Mapping Theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for this to occur.&lt;ref name="RM"/&gt;

Its statement needs some background. A tiling &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., a closed annulus) gives two invariants, &lt;math&gt;M_{\sup} (R,T)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_{\inf} (R,T)&lt;/math&gt;, called [[Extremal length#Discrete extremal length|approximate moduli]]. These are similar to the classical [[Extremal length#extremal distance in an annulus|modulus of a ring]]. They are defined by the use of '''weight functions'''. A weight function &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; assigns a non-negative number called a '''weight''' to each tile of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. Every path in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; can be given a length, defined to be the sum of the weights of all tiles in the path. Define the '''height''' &lt;math&gt;H(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; under &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; to be the infimum of the length of all possible paths connecting the inner boundary of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; to the outer boundary. The '''circumference''' &lt;math&gt;C(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; under &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the infimum of the length of all possible paths circling the ring (i.e. not nullhomotopic in R). The '''area'''&lt;math&gt;A(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; under &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be the sum of the squares of all weights in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. Then  define

: &lt;math&gt;M_{\sup} (R,T)=\sup \frac{H(\rho)^2}{A(\rho)},&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;m_{\inf} (R,T)=\inf \frac{A(\rho)}{C(\rho)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that they are invariant under scaling of the metric.

A sequence &lt;math&gt;T_1,T_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of tilings is '''conformal (&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;)''' if mesh approaches 0 and:

# For each ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, the approximate moduli &lt;math&gt;M_{\sup}(R,T_i)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_{\inf}(R,T_i)&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; sufficiently large, lie in a single interval of the form &lt;math&gt;[r,Kr]&lt;/math&gt;; and
# Given a point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the surface, a neighborhood &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and an integer &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, there is a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;N\smallsetminus\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; separating ''x'' from the complement of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, such that for all large &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; the approximate moduli of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; are all greater than &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="RM"/&gt;

===Statement of theorem===

If a sequence &lt;math&gt;T_1,T_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of tilings of a surface is conformal (&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;) in the above sense, then there is a [[conformal structure]] on the surface and a constant &lt;math&gt;K'&lt;/math&gt; depending only on &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; in which the classical moduli and approximate moduli (from &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; sufficiently large) of any given annulus are &lt;math&gt;K'&lt;/math&gt;-comparable, meaning that they lie in a single interval &lt;math&gt;[r,K'r]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="RM"/&gt;

===Consequences===

The Combinatorial Riemann Mapping Theorem implies that a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; acts geometrically on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}^3&lt;/math&gt; if and only if it is Gromov hyperbolic, it has a sphere at infinity, and the natural subdivision rule on the sphere gives rise to a sequence of tilings that is conformal in the sense above. Thus, Cannon's conjecture would be true if all such subdivision rules were conformal.&lt;ref name="CS"/&gt;

      <text bytes="28792" xml:space="preserve">In [[geometry]], a '''fat object''' is an object in two or more dimensions, whose lengths in the different dimensions are similar. For example, a [[square]] is fat because its length and width are identical. A 2-by-1 [[rectangle]] is thinner than a square, but it is fat relative to a 10-by-1 rectangle. Similarly, a [[circle]] is fatter than a 1-by-10 [[ellipse]] and an [[equilateral triangle]] is fatter than a very [[obtuse triangle]].

Fat objects are especially important in [[computational geometry]]. Many algorithms in computational geometry can perform much better if their input consists of only fat objects; see the [[#Applications|applications]] section below.

== Global fatness ==
[[File:Two-cubes-slimness.png|thumb|right]]
Given a constant ''R''≥1, an object ''o'' is called '''''R''-fat''' if its "slimness factor" is at most ''R''. The "slimness factor" has different definitions in different papers. A common definition&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/s0925-7721(96)00027-2| title = 3-D vertical ray shooting and 2-D point enclosure, range searching, and arc shooting amidst convex fat objects| journal = Computational Geometry| volume = 8| issue = 6| pages = 299–316| year = 1997| last1 = Katz | first1 = M. J. | url = https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00074101/file/RR-2583.pdf}}, {{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0925-7721(95)00005-8| title = Computing depth orders for fat objects and related problems| journal = Computational Geometry| volume = 5| issue = 4| pages = 187| year = 1995| last1 = Agarwal | first1 = P. K. | last2 = Katz | first2 = M. J. | last3 = Sharir | first3 = M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{side of smallest cube enclosing} \ o}{\text{side of largest cube enclosed in} \ o}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''o'' and the [[cube]]s are ''d''-dimensional. A 2-dimensional cube is a [[square]], so the slimness factor of a square is 1 (since its smallest enclosing square is the same as its largest enclosed disk). The slimness factor of a 10-by-1 rectangle is 10. The slimness factor of a circle is √2. Hence, by this definition, a square is 1-fat but a disk and a 10×1 rectangle are not 1-fat. A square is also 2-fat (since its slimness factor is less than 2), 3-fat, etc. A disk is also 2-fat (and also 3-fat etc.), but a 10×1 rectangle is not 2-fat. Every shape is ∞-fat, since by definition the slimness factor is always at most ∞.

The above definition can be termed '''two-cubes''' fatness since it is based on the ratio between the side-lengths of two cubes. Similarly, it is possible to define '''two-balls''' fatness, in which a [[Ball (mathematics)|d-dimensional ball]] is used instead.&lt;ref name=EfratEtAl2000&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/s0925-7721(99)00059-0| title = Dynamic data structures for fat objects and their applications| journal = Computational Geometry| volume = 15| issue = 4| pages = 215| year = 2000| last1 = Efrat | first1 = A. | last2 = Katz | first2 = M. J. | last3 = Nielsen | first3 = F. | last4 = Sharir | first4 = M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2-dimensional ball is a [[Disk (mathematics)|disk]]. According to this alternative definition, a disk is 1-fat but a square is not 1-fat, since its two-balls-slimness is √2.

An alternative definition, that can be termed '''enclosing-ball''' fatness (also called "thickness"&lt;ref name=vanderStappenEtAl1993&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0925-7721(93)90007-s| title = The complexity of the free space for a robot moving amidst fat obstacles| journal = Computational Geometry| volume = 3| issue = 6| pages = 353| year = 1993| last1 = Van Der Stappen | first1 = A. F. | last2 = Halperin | first2 = D. | last3 = Overmars | first3 = M. H. | hdl = 1874/16650| hdl-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is based on the following slimness factor:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\text{volume of smallest ball enclosing} \ o}{\text{volume of} \ o}\right)^{1/d}&lt;/math&gt;

The exponent 1/''d'' makes this definition a ratio of two lengths, so that it is comparable to the two-balls-fatness.

Here, too, a cube can be used instead of a ball.

Similarly it is possible to define the '''enclosed-ball''' fatness based on the following slimness factor:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\text{volume of} \ o}{\text{volume of largest  ball enclosed in} \ o}\right)^{1/d}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Enclosing-fatness vs. enclosed-fatness ===

The enclosing-ball/cube-slimness might be very different from the enclosed-ball/cube-slimness.

For example, consider a [[lollipop]] with a candy in the shape of a 1×1 square and a stick in the shape of a ''b''×(1/''b'') rectangle (with ''b''&gt;1&gt;(1/''b'')). As ''b'' increases, the area of the enclosing cube (≈''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) increases, but the area of the enclosed cube remains constant (=1) and the total area of the shape also remains constant (=2). Thus the enclosing-cube-slimness can grow arbitrarily while the enclosed-cube-slimness remains constant (=√2). See this [http://www.geogebratube.org/student/m100814 GeoGebra page] for a demonstration.

On the other hand, consider a rectilinear 'snake' with width ''1/b'' and length ''b'', that is entirely folded within a square of side length 1. As ''b'' increases, the area of the enclosed cube(≈1/''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) decreases, but the total areas of the snake and of the enclosing cube remain constant (=1). Thus the enclosed-cube-slimness can grow arbitrarily while the enclosing-cube-slimness remains constant (=1).

With both the lollipop and the snake, the two-cubes-slimness grows arbitrarily, since in general:

::'''enclosing-ball-slimness ⋅ enclosed-ball-slimness = two-balls-slimness'''
::'''enclosing-cube-slimness ⋅ enclosed-cube-slimness = two-cubes-slimness'''

Since all slimness factor are at least 1, it follows that if an object ''o'' is R-fat according to the two-balls/cubes definition, it is also R-fat according to the enclosing-ball/cube and enclosed-ball/cube definitions (but the opposite is not true, as exemplified above).

=== Balls vs. cubes ===
The [[Volume of an n-ball|volume of a ''d''-dimensional ball of radius ''r'' is]]: &lt;math&gt;V_d\cdot r^d&lt;/math&gt;, where ''V&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a dimension-dependent constant:
:&lt;math&gt;V_d = \frac{\pi^{d/2}}{\Gamma(\frac{d}{2} + 1)}&lt;/math&gt;

A ''d''-dimensional cube with side-length 2''a'' has volume (2''a'')&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;. It is enclosed in a ''d''-dimensional ball with radius ''a√d'' whose volume is ''V&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;''(''a√d'')&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;. Hence for every ''d''-dimensional object:
::enclosing-ball-slimness ≤ enclosing-cube-slimness ⋅ &lt;math&gt;{V_d}^{1/d}\cdot {\sqrt d} / 2&lt;/math&gt;.

For even dimensions (''d''=2''k''), the factor simplifies to: &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{0.5 \pi k} / {{(k!)}^{1/2k}}&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, for two-dimensional shapes ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=π and the factor is: √(0.5 π)≈1.25, so:

::enclosing-disk-slimness ≤ enclosing-square-slimness ⋅ 1.25

From similar considerations:

::enclosed-cube-slimness ≤ enclosed-ball-slimness ⋅ &lt;math&gt;{V_d}^{1/d}\cdot {\sqrt d} / 2&lt;/math&gt;
::enclosed-square-slimness ≤ enclosed-disk-slimness ⋅ 1.25

A ''d''-dimensional ball with radius ''a'' is enclosed in a ''d''-dimensional cube with side-length 2''a''. Hence for every ''d''-dimensional object:
::enclosing-cube-slimness ≤ enclosing-ball-slimness ⋅ &lt;math&gt;2 / {V_d}^{1/d}&lt;/math&gt;

For even dimensions (''d''=2''k''), the factor simplifies to: &lt;math&gt;2 / {(k!)}^{1/2k} / {\sqrt{\pi}}&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, for two-dimensional shapes the factor is: 2/√π≈1.13, so:

::enclosing-square-slimness ≤ enclosing-disk-slimness ⋅ 1.13

From similar considerations:

::enclosed-ball-slimness ≤ enclosed-cube-slimness ⋅ &lt;math&gt;2 / {V_d}^{1/d}&lt;/math&gt;
::enclosed-disk-slimness ≤ enclosed-square-slimness ⋅ 1.13

Multiplying the above relations gives the following simple relations:

::'''two-balls-slimness ≤ two-cubes-slimness ⋅ √''d'''''
::'''two-cubes-slimness ≤ two-balls-slimness ⋅ √''d'''''

Thus, an ''R''-fat object according to the either the two-balls or the two-cubes definition is at most ''R''√''d''-fat according to the alternative definition.

== Local fatness ==

The above definitions are all ''global'' in the sense that they don't care about small thin areas that are part of a large fat object.

For example, consider a [[lollipop]] with a candy in the shape of a 1×1 square and a stick in the shape of a 1×(1/''b'') rectangle (with ''b''&gt;1&gt;(1/''b'')). As ''b'' increases, the area of the enclosing cube (=4) and the area of the enclosed cube (=1) remain constant, while the total area of the shape changes only slightly (=1+1/''b''). Thus all three slimness factors are bounded: enclosing-cube-slimness≤2, enclosed-cube-slimness≤2, two-cube-slimness=2. Thus by all definitions the lollipop is 2-fat. However, the stick-part of the lollipop obviously becomes thinner and thinner.

In some applications, such thin parts are unacceptable, so '''local fatness''', based on a local slimness factor, may be more appropriate. For every global slimness factor, it is possible to define a local version. For example, for the enclosing-ball-slimness, it is possible to define the '''local-enclosing-ball''' slimness factor of an object ''o'' by considering the set ''B'' of all balls whose center is inside ''o'' and whose boundary intersects the boundary of ''o'' (i.e. not entirely containing ''o''). The local-enclosing-ball-slimness factor is defined as:&lt;ref name=vanderStappenEtAl1993 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1007/3-540-58218-5_6| chapter = New results on binary space partitions in the plane (extended abstract)| title = Algorithm Theory — SWAT '94| volume = 824| pages = 61| series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science| year = 1994| last1 = Berg | first1 = M. | last2 = Groot | first2 = M. | last3 = Overmars | first3 = M. | isbn = 978-3-540-58218-2}}, {{Cite book| doi = 10.1145/177424.177453| chapter = Motion planning amidst fat obstacles (extended abstract)| title = Proceedings of the tenth annual symposium on Computational geometry - SCG '94| pages = 31| year = 1994| last1 = Van Der Stappen | first1 = A.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\cdot \sup_{b \in B}\left(\frac{\text{volume of} \ B}{\text{volume of} \ B\cap o}\right)^{1/d}&lt;/math&gt;

The 1/2 is a normalization factor that makes the local-enclosing-ball-slimness of a ball equal to 1. The local-enclosing-ball-slimness of the lollipop-shape described above is dominated by the 1×(1/''b'') stick, and it goes to ∞ as ''b'' grows. Thus by the local definition the above lollipop is not 2-fat.

=== Global vs. local definitions ===

Local-fatness implies global-fatness. Here is a proof sketch for fatness based on enclosing balls. By definition, the volume of the smallest enclosing ball is ≤ the volume of any other enclosing ball. In particular, it is ≤ the volume of any enclosing ball whose center is inside ''o'' and whose boundary touches the boundary of ''o''. But every such enclosing ball is in the set ''B'' considered by the definition of local-enclosing-ball slimness. Hence:

::enclosing-ball-slimness&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; = 
::= volume(smallest-enclosing-ball)/volume(''o'') 
::≤ volume(enclosing-ball-''b''-in-''B'')/volume(''o'')
::= volume(enclosing-ball-''b''-in-''B'')/volume(''b'' ∩ ''o'')
::≤ (2 local-enclosing-ball-slimness)&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;

Hence:

::'''enclosing-ball-slimness ≤ 2⋅local-enclosing-ball-slimness'''

For a [[convex body]], the opposite is also true: local-fatness implies global-fatness. The proof&lt;ref name=vanderStappenEtAl1993/&gt; is based on the following lemma. Let ''o'' be a convex object. Let ''P'' be a point in ''o''. Let ''b'' and ''B'' be two balls centered at ''P'' such that ''b'' is smaller than ''B''. Then ''o'' intersects a larger portion of ''b'' than of ''B'', i.e.:

::&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\text{volume} \ (b \cap o)}{\text{volume} \ (b)} \geq \frac{\text{volume} \ (B \cap o)}{\text{volume} \ (B)}
&lt;/math&gt;

Proof sketch: standing at the point ''P'', we can look at different angles ''θ'' and measure the distance to the boundary of ''o''. Because ''o'' is convex, this distance is a function, say ''r''(''θ''). We can calculate the left-hand side of the inequality by integrating the following function (multiplied by some determinant function) over all angles:
::&lt;math&gt;f(\theta) = \min{(\frac{r(\theta)}{\text{radius} \ (b)},1)}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly we can calculate the right-hand side of the inequality by integrating the following function:
::&lt;math&gt;F(\theta) = \min{(\frac{r(\theta)}{\text{radius} \ (B)},1)}&lt;/math&gt;

By checking all 3 possible cases, it is possible to show that always &lt;math&gt;f(\theta)\geq F(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the integral of ''f'' is at least the integral of ''F'', and the lemma follows.

The definition of local-enclosing-ball slimness considers ''all'' balls that are centered in a point in ''o'' and intersect the boundary of ''o''. However, when ''o'' is convex, the above lemma allows us to consider, for each point in ''o'', only balls that are maximal in size, i.e., only balls that entirely contain ''o'' (and whose boundary intersects the boundary of ''o''). For every such ball ''b'':

::&lt;math&gt;\text{volume} \ (b)\leq C_d\cdot \text{diameter} \ (o)^d&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C_d&lt;/math&gt; is some dimension-dependent constant.

The diameter of ''o'' is at most the diameter of the smallest ball enclosing ''o'', and the volume of that ball is: &lt;math&gt;C_d\cdot(\text{diameter(smallest ball enclosing} \ o)/2)^d&lt;/math&gt;. Combining all inequalities gives that for every ''convex'' object:

::'''local-enclosing-ball-slimness ≤ enclosing-ball-slimness'''

For non-convex objects, this inequality of course doesn't hold, as exemplified by the lollipop above.

== Fatness of a triangle ==

Slimness is invariant to scale, so the slimness factor of a triangle (as of any other polygon) can be presented as a function of its angles only. The three ball-based slimness factors can be calculated using well-known trigonometric identities.

=== Enclosed-ball slimness ===
The largest circle contained in a triangle is called its [[incircle]]. It is [[Incircle and excircles of a triangle#Relation to area of the triangle|known]] that:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta = r^2\cdot(\cot \frac{\angle A}{2} + \cot \frac{\angle B}{2} + \cot \frac{\angle C}{2})&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Δ'' is the area of a triangle and ''r'' is the radius of the incircle. Hence, the enclosed-ball slimness of a triangle is:

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{ \frac{\cot \frac{\angle A}{2} + \cot \frac{\angle B}{2} + \cot \frac{\angle C}{2}}{\pi} }&lt;/math&gt;


=== Enclosing-ball slimness ===

The smallest containing circle for an [[acute triangle]] is its [[circumcircle]], while for an [[obtuse triangle]] it is the circle having the triangle's longest side as a diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How fat is a triangle?|url=https://math.stackexchange.com/q/915187 |website=Math.SE|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is [[Circumscribed_circle#Triangles|known]] that:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta = R^2 \cdot 2 \sin A \sin B \sin C&lt;/math&gt;

where again ''Δ'' is the area of a triangle and ''R'' is the radius of the circumcircle. Hence, for an acute triangle, the enclosing-ball slimness factor is:

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2 \sin A \sin B \sin C}}&lt;/math&gt;

It is also [[Triangle#Using trigonometry|known]] that:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta = \frac{c^{2}}{2(\cot \angle{A} + \cot \angle{B})} = \frac{c^{2} (\sin \angle{A})(\sin \angle{B})}{2\sin(\angle{A} + \angle{B})}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is any side of the triangle and ''A'',''B'' are the adjacent angles. Hence, for an obtuse triangle with acute angles A and B (and longest side ''c''), the enclosing-ball slimness factor is:

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{\pi\cdot(\cot \angle{A} + \cot \angle{B})}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{\pi\cdot\sin(\angle{A} + \angle{B})}{2 (\sin \angle{A}) (\sin \angle{B})}}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that in a [[right triangle]], &lt;math&gt;\sin{\angle{C}}=\sin{\angle{A}+\angle{B}}=1&lt;/math&gt;, so the two expressions coincide.

=== Two-balls slimness ===

The inradius ''r'' and the circumradius ''R'' are connected via a couple of formulae which provide two alternative expressions for the two-balls slimness of an acute triangle:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weisstein|first1=Eric W|title=Inradius|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Inradius.html|website=MathWorld|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{R}{r} = \frac{1}{4 \sin(\frac{\angle{A}}{2}) \sin(\frac{\angle{B}}{2}) \sin(\frac{\angle{C}} {2})} = \frac{1}{\cos \angle{A}  + \cos \angle{B}  + \cos \angle{C} - 1}&lt;/math&gt;

For an obtuse triangle, ''c''/2 should be used instead of ''R''. By the [[Law of sines]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{2} = R \sin{\angle{C}}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence the slimness factor of an obtuse triangle with obtuse angle ''C'' is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{c/2}{r} = \frac{\sin{\angle{C}}}{4 \sin(\frac{\angle{A}}{2}) \sin(\frac{\angle{B}}{2}) \sin(\frac{\angle{C}} {2})} = \frac{\sin{\angle{C}}}{\cos \angle{A}  + \cos \angle{B}  + \cos \angle{C} - 1}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that in a [[right triangle]], &lt;math&gt;\sin{\angle{C}}=1&lt;/math&gt;, so the two expressions coincide.

The two expressions can be combined in the following way to get a single expression for the two-balls slimness of any triangle with smaller angles ''A'' and ''B'':

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin{\max(\angle{A},\angle{B},\angle{C},\pi/2)}}{4 \sin(\frac{\angle{A}}{2}) \sin(\frac{\angle{B}}{2}) \sin(\frac{\pi-\angle{A}-\angle{B}} {2})} = \frac{\sin{\max(\angle{A},\angle{B},\angle{C},\pi/2)}}{\cos \angle{A}  + \cos \angle{B}  - \cos (\angle{A}+\angle{B}) - 1}&lt;/math&gt;

To get a feeling of the rate of change in fatness, consider what this formula gives for an [[isosceles triangle]] with head angle ''θ'' [[Small-angle approximation|when ''θ'' is small]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin{\max(\theta,\pi/2)}}{4 \sin^2(\frac{\pi-\theta}{4}) \sin(\frac{\theta}{2})} \approx \frac{1}{4 {\sqrt{1/2}}^2 \theta/2}=\frac{1}{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--van der Stappen et al. give the following formula for the enclosing-ball slimness: (√(π/tan''θ'')&lt;ref name=vanderStappenEtAl1993/&gt;) --&gt;

The following graphs show the 2-balls slimness factor of a triangle:
* Slimness of a general triangle [https://www.desmos.com/calculator/zsn0i0hvmr when one angle (''a'') is a constant parameter while the other angle (''x'') changes].
* Slimness of an isosceles triangle [https://www.desmos.com/calculator/rkpz7pscra as a function of its head angle (''x'')].
&lt;!--
=== Cube-based slimness ===
The cube-based slimness of a triangle is much more difficult to calculate than its ball-based slimness.  It can be calculated for an [[isosceles triangle]] with base angles ''θ''.
* When 60°≤''θ''≤arctan(2)=63.5°: enclosing-cube = 2/(√tan''θ''), enclosed-cube = (√tan''θ'')/2+(1/√tan''θ''), two-cubes = 1+2/tan''θ''.
* When arctan(2)=63.5°≤''θ''&lt;90°: two-cubes = 1+tan''θ''/2.
--&gt;

== Fatness of circles, ellipses and their parts ==
The ball-based slimness of a circle is of course 1 - the smallest possible value. 

[[File:Circularsegment.svg|right|150px]]
For a [[circular segment]] with central angle ''θ'', the circumcircle diameter is the length of the chord and the incircle diameter is the height of the segment, so the two-balls slimness (and its approximation [[Small-angle approximation|when ''θ'' is small]]) is:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{length of chord}}{\text{height of segment}}=\frac{2R\sin\frac{\theta}{2}}{R\left(1-\cos\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}=\frac{2\sin\frac{\theta}{2}}{\left(1-\cos\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} \approx \frac{\theta}{\theta^2/8} = \frac{8}{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Circle arc.svg|right|150px]]
For a [[circular sector]] with central angle ''θ'' (when ''θ'' is small), the circumcircle diameter is the radius of the circle and the incircle diameter is the chord length, so the two-balls slimness is:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{radius of circle}}{\text{length of chord}}=\frac{R}{2R\sin\frac{\theta}{2}}=\frac{1}{2\sin\frac{\theta}{2}} \approx \frac{1}{2 \theta / 2} = \frac{1}{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

For an [[ellipse]], the slimness factors are different in different locations. For example, consider an ellipse with short axis ''a'' and long axis ''b''. the length of a chord ranges between &lt;math&gt;2a\sin\frac{\theta}{2}&lt;/math&gt; at the narrow side of the ellipse and &lt;math&gt;2b\sin\frac{\theta}{2}&lt;/math&gt; at its wide side; similarly, the height of the segment ranges between &lt;math&gt;b\left(1-\cos\frac{\theta}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt; at the narrow side and &lt;math&gt;a\left(1-\cos\frac{\theta}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt; at its wide side. So the two-balls slimness ranges between:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2a\sin\frac{\theta}{2}}{b\left(1-\cos\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} \approx \frac{8a}{b\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

and:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2b\sin\frac{\theta}{2}}{a\left(1-\cos\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} \approx \frac{8b}{a\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

In general, when the secant starts at angle Θ the slimness factor can be approximated by:&lt;ref&gt;See graph at: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/fhfqju02sn&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2\sin\frac{\theta}{2}}{\left(1-\cos\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{b}{a}\cos^2(\Theta+\frac{\theta}{2}) + \frac{a}{b}\sin^2(\Theta+\frac{\theta}{2})\right)&lt;/math&gt;

== Fatness of a convex polygon ==
A convex polygon is called ''' ''r''-separated ''' if the angle between each pair of edges (not necessarily adjacent) is at least ''r''. 

Lemma: The enclosing-ball-slimness of an ''r''-separated convex polygon is at most &lt;math&gt;O(1/r)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="bos13"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.20382/jocg.v4i1a9|arxiv=1009.1866|author1=Mark de Berg|title=Fat Polygonal Partitions with Applications to Visualization and Embeddings|journal=Journal of Computational Geometry|volume=4|last2=Onak|first2=Krzysztof|last3=Sidiropoulos|first3=Anastasios|year=2010|s2cid=15245776}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7-8}}

A convex polygon is called ''' ''k,r''-separated ''' if:
# It does not have parallel edges, except maybe two horizontal and two vertical.
# Each non-axis-parallel edge makes an angle of at least ''r'' with any other edge, and with the x and y axes.
# If there are two horizontal edges, then diameter/height is at most ''k''.
# If there are two vertical edges, then diameter/width is at most ''k''.

Lemma: The enclosing-ball-slimness of a ''k,r''-separated convex polygon is at most &lt;math&gt;O(\max(k,1/r))&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="dsv2"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.comgeo.2013.12.008|arxiv=1012.1749|title=Treemaps with bounded aspect ratio|journal=Computational Geometry|volume=47|issue=6|pages=683|year=2014|last1=De Berg|first1=Mark|last2=Speckmann|first2=Bettina|author2-link=Bettina Speckmann|last3=Van Der Weele|first3=Vincent|s2cid=12973376}}.

== Counting fat objects ==
If an object ''o'' has diameter 2''a'', then every ball enclosing ''o'' must have radius at least ''a'' and volume at least ''V&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;''. Hence, by definition of enclosing-ball-fatness, the volume of an ''R''-fat object with diameter 2''a'' must be at least: ''V&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;''/''R&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;''. Hence:

:'''Lemma 1''': Let ''R''≥1 and ''C≥0'' be two constants. Consider a collection of non-overlapping ''d''-dimensional objects that are all globally ''R''-fat  (i.e. with enclosing-ball-slimness ≤ ''R''). The number of such objects of diameter at least 2''a'', contained in a ball of radius ''C⋅a'', is at most: 
::&lt;math&gt;V_d\cdot (C a)^d / (V_d \cdot a^d / R^d) = (R C)^d&lt;/math&gt;

For example (taking ''d''=2, ''R''=1 and ''C''=3): The number of non-overlapping disks with radius at least 1 contained in a circle of radius 3 is at most 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=9. (Actually, it is at most 7).

If we consider local-fatness instead of global-fatness, we can get a stronger lemma:&lt;ref name=vanderStappenEtAl1993/&gt;

:'''Lemma 2''': Let ''R''≥1 and ''C≥0'' be two constants. Consider a collection of non-overlapping ''d''-dimensional objects that are all locally ''R''-fat (i.e. with local-enclosing-ball-slimness ≤ ''R''). Let ''o'' be a single object in that collection with diameter 2''a''. Then the number of objects in the collection with diameter larger than 2''a'' that lie within distance ''2C⋅a'' from object ''o'' is at most:
::&lt;math&gt;(4 R \cdot (C+1))^d&lt;/math&gt;

For example (taking ''d''=2, ''R''=1 and ''C''=0): the number of non-overlapping disks with radius larger than 1 that touch a given unit disk is at most 4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=16 (this is not a tight bound since in this case it is easy to prove an upper bound of 5).

== Generalizations ==
The following generalization of fatness were studied by &lt;ref name=EfratEtAl2000 /&gt; for 2-dimensional objects.

A triangle ∆ is a (β, δ)-triangle of a planar object ''o'' (0&lt;β≤π/3, 0&lt;δ&lt; 1), if ∆ ⊆ ''o'', each of the angles of ∆ is at least β, and the length of each of its edges is at least δ·diameter(''o'').  An object ''o'' in the plane is '''(β,δ)-covered''' if for each point P ∈ ''o'' there exists a (β, δ)-triangle ∆ of ''o'' that contains P.

For [[convex body|convex objects]], the two definitions are equivalent, in the sense that if ''o'' is α-fat, for some constant α, then it is also (β,δ)-covered, for appropriate constants β and δ, and vice versa. However, for non-convex objects the definition of being fat is more general than the definition of being (β, δ)-covered.&lt;ref name=EfratEtAl2000 /&gt;

== Applications ==
Fat objects are used in various problems, for example:
* [[Motion planning]] - planning a path for a robot moving amidst obstacles becomes easier when the obstacles are fat objects.&lt;ref name=vanderStappenEtAl1993/&gt;
* [[Fair cake-cutting]] - dividing a cake becomes more difficult when the pieces have to be fat objects. This requirement is common, for example, when the "cake" to be divided is a land-estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jmateco.2017.01.007|title=Fair and square: Cake-cutting in two dimensions|journal=Journal of Mathematical Economics|volume=70|pages=1–28|year=2017|last1=Segal-Halevi|first1=Erel|last2=Nitzan|first2=Shmuel|last3=Hassidim|first3=Avinatan|last4=Aumann|first4=Yonatan|arxiv=1409.4511|s2cid=1278209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems of the following type, and their solution techniques, were first studied in the 18th century, and the general topic became known as '''geometric probability'''.

* ([[Buffon's needle]]) What is the chance that a needle dropped randomly onto a floor marked with equally spaced parallel lines will cross one of the lines?
* What is the mean length of a random chord of a unit circle? (cf. [[Bertrand's paradox (probability)|Bertrand's paradox]]).
* What is the chance that three random points in the plane form an acute (rather than obtuse) triangle?
* What is the mean area of the polygonal regions formed when randomly oriented lines are spread over the plane?

For mathematical development see the concise monograph by Solomon.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 20th century the topic has split into two topics with different emphases.  [[Integral geometry]] sprang from the principle that the mathematically natural probability models are those that are invariant under certain transformation groups.  This topic emphasises systematic development of formulas for calculating expected values associated with the geometric 
objects derived from random points, and can in part be viewed as a sophisticated branch of [[multivariate calculus]].  [[Stochastic geometry]] emphasises the random geometrical objects themselves.  For instance: different models for random lines or for random tessellations of the plane; random sets formed by making points of a [[Poisson process|spatial Poisson process]] be (say) centers of discs.

In [[mathematics]], a '''geometric transformation''' is any [[bijection]] of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] to itself (or to another such set) with some salient geometrical underpinning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Definitive Glossary of Higher Mathematical Jargon — Transformation|url=https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#transformation|last=|first=|date=2019-08-01|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, it is a function whose domain and range are sets of points — most often both &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; or both &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; — such that the function is [[Injective function|injective]] so that its [[Inverse function|inverse]] exists.&lt;ref&gt;Zalman Usiskin, Anthony L.

[[File:A5-A7.gif|240px|thumb|A [[snub cube]] can be constructed from a transformed [[rhombicuboctahedron]] by rotating the 6 blue square faces until the 12 white square become pairs of equilateral triangles.]]
In [[geometry]], a '''snub''' is an operation applied to a polyhedron. The term originates from [[Kepler]]'s names of two [[Archimedean solid]]s, for the [[snub cube]] (cubus simus) and [[snub dodecahedron]] (dodecaedron simum).&lt;ref&gt;[[Kepler]], ''Harmonices Mundi'', 1619&lt;/ref&gt; In general, snubs have chiral symmetry with two forms, with clockwise or counterclockwise orientations. By Kepler's names, a snub can be seen as an [[Expansion (geometry)|expansion]] of a regular polyhedron, with the faces moved apart, and twists on their centers, adding new polygons centered on the original vertices, and pairs of triangles fitting between the original edges.

The terminology was generalized by [[Coxeter]], with a slightly different definition, for a wider set of [[uniform polytope]]s.

== Conway snubs ==
[[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] explored generalized polyhedron operators, defining what is now called [[Conway polyhedron notation]], which can be applied to polyhedra and tilings. Conway calls Coxeter's operation a ''semi-snub''.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, (2008) p.287 Coxeter's semi-snub operation&lt;/ref&gt;

In this notation, [[Conway snub operator|snub]] is defined by the dual and [[Conway gyro operator|gyro]] operators, as ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''dg'', and it is equivalent to an [[alternation (geometry)|alternation]] of a truncation of an [[Conway ambo operator|ambo]] operator. Conway's notation itself avoids Coxeter's alternation (half) operation since it only applies for polyhedra with only even-sided faces.

In 4-dimensions, Conway suggests the [[snub 24-cell]] should be called a ''semi-snub 24-cell'' because it doesn't represent an alternated [[omnitruncated 24-cell]] like his 3-dimensional polyhedron usage. It is instead actually an alternated [[truncated 24-cell]].&lt;ref&gt;Conway, 2008, p.401 Gosset's Semi-snub Polyoctahedron&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coxeter]]'s snub terminology is slightly different, meaning an [[alternation (geometry)|alternated]] [[Truncation (geometry)|truncation]], deriving the [[snub cube]] as a ''snub [[cuboctahedron]]'', and the [[snub dodecahedron]] as a ''snub [[icosidodecahedron]]''. This definition is used in the naming two [[Johnson solid]]s: [[snub disphenoid]], and [[snub square antiprism]], as well as higher dimensional polytopes such as the 4-dimensional [[snub 24-cell]], {{CDD|node_h|3|node_h|4|node|3|node}} or s{3,4,3}.

A [[regular polyhedron]] (or tiling) with Schläfli symbol, &lt;math&gt;\begin{Bmatrix} p , q \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, and [[Coxeter diagram]] {{CDD|node_1|p|node|q|node}}, has [[Truncation (geometry)|truncation]] defined as &lt;math&gt;t \begin{Bmatrix} p , q \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, and {{CDD|node_1|p|node_1|q|node}} and snub defined as an [[alternation (geometry)|alternated]] truncation &lt;math&gt;ht \begin{Bmatrix} p , q \end{Bmatrix} = s \begin{Bmatrix} p , q \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, and Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node_h|p|node_h|q|node}}. This construction requires ''q'' to be even.

A [[quasiregular polyhedron]] &lt;math&gt;\begin{Bmatrix} p \\ q \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; or ''r''{''p'',''q''}, with Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node_1|split1-pq|nodes}} or {{CDD|node|p|node_1|q|node}} has a quasiregular [[Truncation (geometry)|truncation]] defined as &lt;math&gt;t\begin{Bmatrix} p \\ q \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; or ''tr''{''p'',''q''}, and Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node_1|split1-pq|nodes_11}} or {{CDD|node_1|p|node_1|q|node_1}} and quasiregular snub defined as an [[alternation (geometry)|alternated]] truncated rectification &lt;math&gt;ht\begin{Bmatrix} p \\ q \end{Bmatrix} = s\begin{Bmatrix} p \\ q \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; or ''htr''{''p'',''q''} = ''sr''{''p'',''q''}, and Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node_h|split1-pq|nodes_hh}} or {{CDD|node_h|p|node_h|q|node_h}}.

For example, Kepler's '''[[snub cube]]''' is derived from the quasiregular [[cuboctahedron]], with a vertical [[Schläfli symbol]] &lt;math&gt;\begin{Bmatrix} 4 \\ 3 \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, and [[Coxeter diagram]] {{CDD|node_1|split1-43|nodes}}, and so is more explicitly called a '''snub cuboctahedron''', expressed by a vertical Schläfli symbol &lt;math&gt;s\begin{Bmatrix} 4 \\ 3 \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node_h|split1-43|nodes_hh}}. The snub cuboctahedron is the alternation of the ''truncated cuboctahedron'', &lt;math&gt;t\begin{Bmatrix} 4 \\ 3 \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and {{CDD|node_1|split1-43|nodes_11}}.

Regular polyhedra with even-order vertices to also be snubbed as alternated truncation, like a ''snub octahedron'', &lt;math&gt;s\begin{Bmatrix} 3 , 4 \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, {{CDD|node_h|3|node_h|4|node}} (and ''snub tetratetrahedron'', as &lt;math&gt;s\begin{Bmatrix} 3 \\ 3 \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, {{CDD|node_h|split1|nodes_hh}}) represents the [[pseudoicosahedron]], a regular [[icosahedron]] with [[pyritohedral symmetry]].  The ''snub octahedron'' is the alternation of the [[truncated octahedron]], &lt;math&gt;t\begin{Bmatrix} 3 , 4 \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and {{CDD|node_1|3|node_1|4|node}}, or tetrahedral symmetry form: &lt;math&gt;t\begin{Bmatrix} 3 \\ 3 \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and {{CDD|node_1|split1|nodes_11}}.

Coxeter's snub operation also allows n-[[antiprism]]s to be defined as &lt;math&gt;s\begin{Bmatrix} 2 \\ n \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;s\begin{Bmatrix} 2 , 2n \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, based on n-prisms &lt;math&gt;t\begin{Bmatrix} 2 \\ n \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;t\begin{Bmatrix} 2 , 2n \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;\begin{Bmatrix} 2 , n \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; is a regular n-[[hosohedron]], a degenerate polyhedron, but a valid tiling on the sphere with [[digon]] or [[lune (geometry)|lune]]-shaped faces.

=== Coxeter's higher-dimensional snubbed polytopes and honeycombs ===
In general, a regular polychoron with [[Schläfli symbol]], &lt;math&gt;\begin{Bmatrix} p , q, r \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, and [[Coxeter diagram]] {{CDD|node_1|p|node|q|node|r|node}}, has a snub with [[extended Schläfli symbol]] &lt;math&gt;s \begin{Bmatrix} p , q, r \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, and {{CDD|node_h|p|node_h|q|node|r|node}} .

A rectified polychoron &lt;math&gt;\begin{Bmatrix} p \\ q, r \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; = '''r{p,q,r}''', and {{CDD|node|p|node_1|q|node|r|node}}  has snub symbol &lt;math&gt;s\begin{Bmatrix} p \\ q , r \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; = '''sr{p,q,r}''', and {{CDD|node_h|p|node_h|q|node_h|r|node}}.

=== Examples===
[[File:Ortho solid 969-uniform polychoron 343-snub.png|thumb|Orthogonal projection of [[snub 24-cell]]]]
There is only one uniform convex snub in 4-dimensions, the [[snub 24-cell]]. The regular [[24-cell]] has [[Schläfli symbol]], &lt;math&gt;\begin{Bmatrix} 3 , 4, 3 \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, and  [[Coxeter diagram]] {{CDD|node_1|3|node|4|node|3|node}}, and the snub 24-cell is represented by &lt;math&gt;s\begin{Bmatrix} 3 , 4, 3 \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, [[Coxeter diagram]] {{CDD|node_h|3|node_h|4|node|3|node}}. It also has an index 6 lower symmetry constructions as &lt;math&gt;s\left\{\begin{array}{l}3\\3\\3\end{array}\right\}&lt;/math&gt; or s{3&lt;sup&gt;1,1,1&lt;/sup&gt;} and {{CDD|node_h|splitsplit1|branch3_hh|node_h}}, and an index 3 subsymmetry as &lt;math&gt;s\begin{Bmatrix} 3 \\ 3 , 4 \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; or sr{3,3,4}, and {{CDD|node_h|3|node_h|3|node_h|4|node}} or {{CDD|node_h|split1|nodes_hh|4a|nodea}}.

The related [[snub 24-cell honeycomb]] can be seen as a &lt;math&gt;s\begin{Bmatrix} 3 , 4, 3, 3 \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; or s{3,4,3,3}, and {{CDD|node_h|3|node_h|4|node|3|node|3|node}}, and lower symmetry &lt;math&gt;s\begin{Bmatrix} 3 \\ 3 , 4, 3 \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; or sr{3,3,4,3} and {{CDD|node_h|3|node_h|3|node_h|4|node|3|node}} or {{CDD|node_h|split1|nodes_hh|3a|nodea|4a|nodea}}, and lowest symmetry form as &lt;math&gt;s\left\{\begin{array}{l}3\\3\\3\\3\end{array}\right\}&lt;/math&gt; or s{3&lt;sup&gt;1,1,1,1&lt;/sup&gt;} and {{CDD|nodes_hh|split2|node_h|split1|nodes_hh}}.

A Euclidean honeycomb is an [[alternated hexagonal slab honeycomb]], s{2,6,3}, and {{CDD|node_h|2x|node_h|6|node|3|node}} or sr{2,3,6}, and {{CDD|node_h|2x|node_h|3|node_h|6|node}} or sr{2,3&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;}, and {{CDD|node_h|2x|node_h|split1|branch_hh}}.
: [[File:Tetroctahedric semicheck.png|160px]]

Another Euclidean (scaliform) honeycomb is an [[alternated square slab honeycomb]], s{2,4,4}, and {{CDD|node_h|2x|node_h|4|node|4|node}} or sr{2,4&lt;sup&gt;1,1&lt;/sup&gt;} and {{CDD|node_h|2x|node_h|split1-44|nodes_hh}}:
: [[File:Alternated cubic slab honeycomb.png|160px]]

The only uniform snub hyperbolic uniform honeycomb is the ''snub hexagonal tiling honeycomb'', as s{3,6,3} and {{CDD|node_h|3|node_h|6|node|3|node}}, which can also be constructed as an [[alternated hexagonal tiling honeycomb]], h{6,3,3}, {{CDD|node_h1|6|node|3|node|3|node}}. It is also constructed as s{3&lt;sup&gt;[3,3]&lt;/sup&gt;} and {{CDD|branch_hh|splitcross|branch_hh}}.

Another hyperbolic (scaliform) honeycomb is a [[snub order-4 octahedral honeycomb]], s{3,4,4}, and {{CDD|node_h|3|node_h|4|node|4|node}}.

[[File:Coin_rotation_paradox_animation.gif|thumb|The coin rotation illusion. The outer coin has made a full rotation having come back to the same position after only rotating about half of the inner coin. Fully rotating around the inner coin it will have completed 2 rotations.]]

[[File:Cardioid animation.gif|thumb|The path of a single point on the edge of the moving coin is a [[cardioid]].]]
The '''coin rotation paradox''' is the counter-intuitive observation that, when one coin is rolled around the rim of another coin of equal size, the moving coin completes two full rotations after going all the way around the stationary coin.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Coin Paradox|urlname=CoinParadox}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

==Description==
Start with two identical [[coin]]s touching each other on a table, with their "head" sides displayed and parallel. Keeping coin A stationary, rotate coin B around A, keeping a point of contact with no slippage. As coin B reaches the opposite side, the two heads will again be parallel; B has made one revolution. Continuing to move B brings it back to the starting position and completes a second revolution. Paradoxically, coin B has rolled a distance equal to twice its circumference. 

As coin B rotates, each point on its perimeter describes (moves through) a [[cardioid]] curve.

==Comparison==
The rolling coin participates in two separate motions like the moon relative to the earth (except that the moon completes only one rotation about every 28 days). The moon rotates once while revolving around an elliptical pathway relative to true north while the moving coin rotates twice as it revolves around the center of the other (still) coin.

[[File:BlockSlidingOverACircle.png|thumb|Sliding over a circle, without rotation]]
==Analysis and Solution==
From start to end the center of the moving coin travels a circular path. The edge of the stationary coin and said path form two concentric circles. The radius of the path is twice either coin's radius. Hence, the circumference of the path is twice either coin's circumference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mathematical Fallacies and Paradoxes |first=Bryan H. |last=Bunch |year=1982 |publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold |pages=10–11 |isbn=0-442-24905-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; To go all the way around the stationary coin, the center of the moving coin must travel twice the coin's circumference. How much the moving coin rotates around its own center en route, if any, or in what direction – clockwise, counterclockwise, or some of both – has no effect on the length of the path. That the coin rotates twice as described above and focusing on the edge of the moving coin as it touches the stationary coin are distractions.

==Unequal radii and other shapes==
[[File:coin_rotation_paradox.svg|thumb|300px|link={{filepath:coin_rotation_paradox.svg}}|Visualisation for coins of unequal radii [{{filepath:coin_rotation_paradox.svg}} (animation)] ]]
A coin of radius ''r'' rolling around one of radius ''R'' makes ''R/r'' + 1 rotations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh5coE5wJ2I Two Circles Math Problem] &lt;/ref&gt;
That is because the center of the rolling coin travels a circular path with a radius (or circumference) of ''(R + r)/r'' = ''R/r'' + 1 times its own radius (or circumference). In the limiting case when ''R'' = 0, the coin with radius ''r'' makes 0/''r'' + 1 = 1 simple rotation around its bottom point.

In the example in the figure, ''R'' = 3''r''. In figure 1, with ''R'' straightened out, the number of rotations (number of times the arrow points upward) is ''R/r'' = 3. In figure 2, as ''R'' has been restored into a circle, the coin makes an extra rotation, giving ''R/r'' + 1 = 4.

The May 1st, 1982 [[SAT]] had a question concerning this problem, and, due to human error, had to be regraded after 3 students proved there was no correct answer among the choices.&lt;ref name="satcoinparadox"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/25/us/error-found-in-sat-question.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The shape around which the coin is rolled need not be a circle: one extra rotation is added to the ratio of their perimeters when it is any [[simple polygon]] or closed curve which does not intersect itself. If the shape is [[complex polygon|complex]], the number of rotations added (or subtracted, if the coin rolls inside the curve) is the absolute value of its [[winding number|turning number]].

A '''great ellipse''' is an [[ellipse]] passing through two [[point (geometry)|points]] on a [[spheroid]] and having the same [[center (geometry)|center]] as that of the spheroid. Equivalently, it is an ellipse on the [[surface (geometry)|surface]] of a spheroid and centered on the [[origin (geometry)|origin]], or the curve formed by intersecting the spheroid by a plane through its center.&lt;ref&gt;

For points that are separated by less than about a quarter of the [[circumference of the earth]], about &lt;math&gt;10\,000\,\mathrm{km}&lt;/math&gt;, the length of the great ellipse connecting the points is close (within one part in 500,000) to the [[geodesics on an ellipsoid|geodesic distance]].&lt;ref&gt;

The great ellipse therefore is sometimes proposed as a suitable route for marine navigation.
The great ellipse is special case of an [[earth section paths|earth section path]].

== Introduction ==

Assume that the spheroid, an ellipsoid of revolution, has an equatorial radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and polar semi-axis &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. Define the flattening &lt;math&gt;f=(a-b)/a&lt;/math&gt;, the eccentricity &lt;math&gt;e=\sqrt{f(2-f)}&lt;/math&gt;, and the second eccentricity &lt;math&gt;e'=e/(1-f)&lt;/math&gt;. Consider two points: &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; at (geographic) latitude &lt;math&gt;\phi_1&lt;/math&gt; and longitude &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; at latitude &lt;math&gt;\phi_2&lt;/math&gt; and longitude &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt;. The connecting great ellipse (from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;) has length &lt;math&gt;s_{12}&lt;/math&gt; and has [[azimuth]]s &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2&lt;/math&gt; at the two endpoints.

There are various ways to map an ellipsoid into a sphere of radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in such a way as to map the great ellipse into a great circle, allowing the methods of [[great-circle navigation]] to be used:
* The ellipsoid can be stretched in a direction parallel to the axis of rotation; this maps a point of latitude &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; on the ellipsoid to a point on the sphere with latitude &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, the [[latitude#parametric latitude|parametric latitude]].
* A point on the ellipsoid can mapped radially onto the sphere along the line connecting it with the center of the ellipsoid; this maps a point of latitude &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; on the ellipsoid to a point on the sphere with latitude &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, the [[latitude#geocentric latitude|geocentric latitude]].
* The ellipsoid can be stretched into a prolate ellipsoid with polar semi-axis &lt;math&gt;a^2/b&lt;/math&gt; and then mapped radially onto the sphere; this preserves the latitude&amp;mdash;the latitude on the sphere is &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, the [[latitude#geographic latitude|geographic latitude]].

The last method gives an easy way to generate a succession of way-points on the great ellipse connecting two known points &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. Solve for the great circle between &lt;math&gt;(\phi_1,\lambda_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\phi_2,\lambda_2)&lt;/math&gt; and find the [[Great-circle navigation#Finding way-points|way-points on the great circle]]. These map into way-points on the corresponding great ellipse.

== Mapping the great ellipse to a great circle ==

If distances and headings are needed, it is simplest to use the first of the mappings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| ref = harv| doi = 10.2478/v10156-011-0040-9| title = Solutions to the direct and inverse navigation problems on the great ellipse| journal = Journal of Geodetic Science| volume = 2| issue = 3| year = 2012c| pages = 200&amp;ndash;205| last1 = Sjöberg | first1 = L. E.| bibcode = 2012JGeoS...2..200S| doi-access = free}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In detail, the mapping is as follows (this description is taken from &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|ref = harv |year = 2014
|title = Great ellipses
|last = Karney |first = C. F. F.
|url = https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/1.38/greatellipse.html
|postscript = . From the documentation of GeographicLib 1.38.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;):

* The geographic latitude &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; on the ellipsoid maps to the parametric latitude &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; on the sphere, where&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;a\tan\beta = b\tan\phi.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* The longitude &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is unchanged.
* The azimuth &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; on the ellipsoid maps to an azimuth &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; on the sphere where&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\tan\alpha &amp;= \frac{\tan\gamma}{\sqrt{1-e^2\cos^2\beta}}, \\
\tan\gamma &amp;= \frac{\tan\alpha}{\sqrt{1+e'^2\cos^2\phi}},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;and the quadrants of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; are the same.
* Positions on the great circle of radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; are parametrized by arc length &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; measured from the northward crossing of the equator. The great ellipse has a semi-axes &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a \sqrt{1 - e^2\cos^2\gamma_0}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_0&lt;/math&gt; is the great-circle azimuth at the northward equator crossing, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the parametric angle on the ellipse.

(A similar mapping to an auxiliary sphere is carried out in the solution of [[geodesics on an ellipsoid]]. The differences are that the azimuth &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is conserved in the mapping, while the longitude &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; maps to a "spherical" longitude &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;. The equivalent ellipse used for distance calculations has semi-axes &lt;math&gt;b \sqrt{1 + e'^2\cos^2\alpha_0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.)

== Solving the inverse problem ==

The "inverse problem" is the determination of &lt;math&gt;s_{12}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2&lt;/math&gt;, given the positions of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. This is solved by computing &lt;math&gt;\beta_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_2&lt;/math&gt; and solving for the [[great-circle navigation|great-circle]] between &lt;math&gt;(\beta_1,\lambda_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\beta_2,\lambda_2)&lt;/math&gt;.

The spherical azimuths are relabeled as &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; (from &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;). Thus &lt;math&gt;\gamma_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_2&lt;/math&gt; and the spherical azimuths at the equator and at &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. The azimuths of the endpoints of great ellipse, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2&lt;/math&gt;, are computed from &lt;math&gt;\gamma_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_2&lt;/math&gt;.

The semi-axes of the great ellipse can be found using the value of &lt;math&gt;\gamma_0&lt;/math&gt;.

Also determined as part of the solution of the great circle problem are the arc lengths, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{01}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{02}&lt;/math&gt;, measured from the equator crossing to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. The distance &lt;math&gt;s_{12}&lt;/math&gt; is found by computing the length of a portion of perimeter of the ellipse using the formula giving the [[meridian arc#Series in terms of the parametric latitude|meridian arc in terms the parametric latitude]]. In applying this formula, use the semi-axes for the great ellipse (instead of for the meridian) and substitute &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{01}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{02}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

The solution of the "direct problem", determining the position of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;s_{12}&lt;/math&gt;, can be similarly be found (this requires, in addition, the [[Meridian arc#The inverse meridian problem for the ellipsoid|inverse meridian distance formula]]). This also enables way-points (e.g., a series of equally spaced intermediate points) to be found in the solution of the inverse problem.

      <text bytes="1581" xml:space="preserve">In mathematics, '''noncommutative projective geometry''' is a noncommutative analog of [[projective geometry]] in the setting of [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]].

== Examples ==
*The quantum plane, the most basic example, is the [[quotient ring]] of the free ring:
::&lt;math&gt;k \langle x, y \rangle / (yx - q xy)&lt;/math&gt;
*More generally, the '''quantum polynomial ring''' is the quotient ring:
::&lt;math&gt;k \langle x_1, \dots, x_n \rangle / (x_i x_j - q_{ij} x_j x_i)&lt;/math&gt;

== Proj construction ==
{{see also|Proj construction}}

By definition, the Proj of a graded ring ''R'' is the quotient category of the category of finitely generated graded modules over ''R'' by the subcategory of torsion modules. If ''R'' is a commutative Noetherian graded ring generated by degree-one elements, then the Proj of ''R'' in this sense is equivalent to the category of [[coherent sheaf|coherent sheaves]] on the usual Proj of ''R''. Hence, the construction can be thought of as a generalization of the Proj construction for a commutative graded ring.

In [[geometry]], the '''Cramer–Castillon problem''' is a problem stated by the [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[mathematician]] [[Gabriel Cramer]] solved by the Italian mathematician, resident in Berlin, [[Giovanni Salvemini|Jean de Castillon]] in 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Stark}}, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem consists of (see the image):

Given a circle &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; and three points &lt;math&gt;A, B, C&lt;/math&gt; in the same plane and not on &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, to construct every possible triangle inscribed in &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; whose sides (or their elongations) pass through &lt;math&gt;A, B, C&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

Centuries before, [[Pappus of Alexandria]] had solved a special case: when the three points are collinear. But the general case had the reputation of being very difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Wanner}}, page 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the geometrical construction of Castillon, [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] found an analytic solution, easier than Castillon's. In the beginning of the 19th century, [[Lazare Carnot]] generalized it to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; points.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Ostermann and Wanner}}, page 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, a '''sheaf of planes''' is the set of all [[plane (geometry)|planes]] that have the same common [[line (geometry)|line]].&lt;ref name="def"&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SheafofPlanes.html Definition on ''Mathworld Wolfram'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sommerville|first1=D.

When extending the concept of line to the [[line at infinity]], a set of '''parallel planes''' can be seen as a ''sheaf of planes'' intersecting in a ''line at infinity''. To distinguish it from the more common definition the adjective ''parallel'' can be added to it, resulting in the expression: ''parallel sheaf of planes''.&lt;ref name="para"&gt;[http://www.vitutor.com/geometry/space/sheaf_planes.html Vitutor: Sheaf of Planes]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="4902" xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], the '''Almgren–Pitts min-max theory''' (named after [[Frederick J. Almgren, Jr.]] and his student [[Jon T. Pitts]]) is an analogue of [[Morse theory]] for [[hypersurface]]s.

The theory started with the efforts for generalizing [[George David Birkhoff]]'s method for the construction of simple closed [[geodesic]]s on the sphere, to allow the construction of [[embedding|embedded]] [[minimal surface]]s in arbitrary [[3-manifold]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tobias Colding]] and [[Camillo De Lellis]]: "[https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0303305 The min-max construction of minimal surfaces]", Surveys in Differential Geometry&lt;/ref&gt;

It has played roles in the solutions to a number of [[conjecture]]s in [[geometry]] and [[topology]] found by Almgren and Pitts themselves and also by other mathematicians, such as [[Mikhail Leonidovich Gromov|Mikhail Gromov]], [[Richard Schoen]], [[Shing-Tung Yau]], [[Fernando Codá Marques]], [[André Neves]], [[Ian Agol]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://numdam.mathdoc.fr/numdam-bin/item?id=ASNSP_2006_5_5_4_483_0 |author1=Giaquinta, Mariano |author2=Mucci, Domenico |title=The BV-energy of maps into a manifold : relaxation and density results |publisher=Annali della Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa – Classe di Scienze, Sér. 5, 5 |number=4 |date=2006 |pages=483–548 |access-date=2015-05-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610171642/http://numdam.mathdoc.fr/numdam-bin/item?id=ASNSP_2006_5_5_4_483_0 |archive-date=2015-06-10 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helge Holden, Ragni Piene – The Abel Prize 2008-2012, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Osserman]] – A Survey of Minimal Surfaces, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://intlpress.com/site/pub/pages/journals/items/cdm/content/vols/2013/0001/a001/index.html |title=Content Online - CDM 2013 Article 1 |publisher=Intlpress.com |accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~aneves/papers/CDM-harvard3.pdf |format=PDF |title=Applications of Almgren-Pitts Min-max theory |author1=Fernando C.

The '''Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry''' is an award granted by the [[American Mathematical Society]] for notable research in [[geometry]] or [[topology]].  It was founded in 1961 in memory of [[Oswald Veblen]].  The Veblen Prize is now worth US$5000, and is awarded every three years.

The first seven prize winners were awarded for works in topology. [[James Harris Simons]] and [[William Thurston]] were the first ones to receive it for works in geometry (for some distinctions, see [[geometry and topology]]).&lt;ref name="DurenAskey1989"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Peter L.

      <text bytes="5561" xml:space="preserve">In [[geometry]], the '''circumcenter of mass''' is a center associated with a [[polygon]] which shares many of the properties of the [[center of mass]]. More generally, the circumcenter of mass may be defined for [[simplicial polytope]]s and also in the [[spherical geometry|spherical]] and [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]] geometries.

In the special case when the polytope is a [[quadrilateral]] or [[hexagon]], the circumcenter of mass has been called the "quasicircumcenter" and has been used to define an [[Euler line]] of a quadrilateral.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Myakishev | first = Alexei | journal = Forum Geometricorum | pages = 289–295
 | title = On Two Remarkable Lines Related to a Quadrilateral | url = http://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2006volume6/FG200634.pdf | volume = 6 | year = 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = de Villiers | first = Michael | journal = Forum Geometricorum | pages = 233–236 | title = Quasi-circumcenters and a generalization of the quasi-Euler line to a hexagon | url = http://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2014volume14/FG201421.pdf | volume = 14 | year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The circumcenter of mass allows us to define an Euler line for simplicial polytopes.

==Definition in the plane==
Let &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; be an oriented polygon (with vertices counted countercyclically) in the plane with vertices &lt;math&gt;V_1,V_2,\ldots,V_n&lt;/math&gt;  and let &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary point not lying on the sides (or their [[extended side|extensions]]). Consider the triangulation of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; by the oriented triangles &lt;math&gt;O V_i V_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; (the index &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is viewed modulo &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;). Associate with each of these triangles its circumcenter &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt; with weight equal to its oriented area (positive if its sequence of vertices is countercyclical; negative otherwise). The circumcenter of mass of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the [[center of mass]] of these weighted circumcenters. The result is independent of the choice of point &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Tabachnikov | first1 = Serge | last2 = Tsukerman | first2 = Emmanuel | date = May 2014 | issue = 4 | journal = [[Discrete and Computational Geometry]] | volume = 51 | pages = 815–836 | title = Circumcenter of Mass and Generalized Euler Line | doi = 10.1007/s00454-014-9597-2| arxiv = 1301.0496 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PolyCCM.svg|thumb|Circumcenter of mass of a polygon.]]

==Properties==
In the special case when the polygon is [[cyclic polygon|cyclic]], the circumcenter of mass coincides with the [[circumcenter]].

The circumcenter of mass satisfies an analog of Archimedes' Lemma, which states that if a polygon is decomposed into two smaller polygons, then the circumcenter of mass of that polygon is a weighted sum of the circumcenters of mass of the two smaller polygons. As a consequence, any triangulation with nondegenerate triangles may be used to define the circumcenter of mass.

For an [[equilateral polygon]], the circumcenter of mass and center of mass coincide. More generally, the circumcenter of mass and center of mass coincide for a simplicial polytope for which each face has the sum of squares of its edges a constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Akopyan| first1 = Arseniy | date = May 2014 | issue = 4 | journal = [[Discrete and Computational Geometry]] | volume = 51 | pages = 837–841 | title = Some Remarks on the Circumcenter of Mass | doi = 10.1007/s00454-014-9596-3 | arxiv = 1512.08655 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;V_i=(x_i,y_i)&lt;/math&gt; be the vertices of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; denote its area. The circumcenter of mass &lt;math&gt;CCM(P)&lt;/math&gt; of the polygon &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is given by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;
CCM(P)=\frac{1}{4 A}(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} -y_i y_{i+1}^2+y_i^2 y_{i+1} +x_i^2 y_{i+1}-x_{i+1}^2 y_i, \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} -x_{i+1} y_i^2+x_i y_{i+1}^2+x_i x_{i+1}^2-x_i^2 x_{i+1}).
&lt;/math&gt;

The circumcenter of mass can be extended to smooth curves via a limiting procedure. This continuous limit coincides with the center of mass of the homogeneous [[planar lamina|lamina]] bounded by the curve.

Under natural assumptions, the centers of polygons which satisfy Archimedes' Lemma are precisely the points of its Euler line. In other words, the only "well-behaved" centers which satisfy Archimedes' Lemma are the affine combinations of the circumcenter of mass and center of mass.

==Generalized Euler line==

The circumcenter of mass allows an [[Euler line]] to be defined for any polygon (and more generally, for a simplicial polytope). This [[Euler line#Simplicial polytope|generalized Euler line]] is defined as the affine span of the center of mass and circumcenter of mass of the polytope.

==Geometry==
The catenoid was the first non-trivial minimal [[surface (topology)|surface]] in 3-dimensional Euclidean space to be discovered apart from the [[plane (geometry)|plane]]. The catenoid is obtained by rotating a catenary about its [[Directrix (conic section)|directrix]].&lt;ref name=Gullberg/&gt; It was found and proved to be minimal by [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1744.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Helveticae|first1=Euler, Leonhard |editor= Carathëodory Constantin |title=Methodus inveniendi lineas curvas: maximi minimive proprietate gaudentes sive solutio problematis isoperimetrici latissimo sensu accepti |date=1952 |orig-year=reprint of 1744 edition |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media  |isbn=3-76431-424-9 |language=Latin |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Methodus_inveniendi_lineas_curvas_maximi.html?id=zNDdVFZalSAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Colding06&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Colding|first1=T.

The catenoid may be defined by the following parametric equations:

:&lt;math&gt;x=c \cosh \frac{v}{c} \cos u&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y=c \cosh \frac{v}{c} \sin u&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;z=v&lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;u \in [-\pi, \pi)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a non-zero real constant.

In cylindrical coordinates:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho =c \cosh \frac{z}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a real constant.

A physical model of a catenoid can be formed by dipping two [[circle|circular]] rings into a soap solution and slowly drawing the circles apart.

The catenoid may be also defined approximately by the [[Stretched grid method]] as a facet 3D model.

== Helicoid transformation ==

[[Image:helicatenoid.gif|thumb|right|256px|alt=Continuous animation showing a helicoid deforming into a catenoid and back to a helicoid|Deformation of a [[helicoid]] into a catenoid]]

Because they are members of the same [[associate family]] of surfaces, one can bend a catenoid into a portion of a [[helicoid]] without stretching.  In other words, one can make a (mostly) [[continuous function|continuous]] and [[Isometry|isometric]] deformation of a catenoid to a portion of the [[helicoid]] such that every member of the deformation family is [[Minimal surface|minimal]] (having a [[mean curvature]] of zero).  A [[Parametric equation|parametrization]] of such a deformation is given by the system

:&lt;math&gt;x(u,v) = \cos \theta \,\sinh v \,\sin u + \sin \theta \,\cosh v \,\cos u&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y(u,v) = -\cos \theta \,\sinh v \,\cos u + \sin \theta \,\cosh v \,\sin u&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;z(u,v) = u \cos \theta + v \sin \theta &lt;/math&gt;

:for &lt;math&gt;(u,v) \in (-\pi, \pi] \times (-\infty, \infty)&lt;/math&gt;, with deformation parameter &lt;math&gt;-\pi &lt; \theta \le \pi&lt;/math&gt;,

where 
&lt;math&gt;\theta = \pi&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to a right-handed helicoid, 
&lt;math&gt;\theta = \pm \pi / 2&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to a catenoid, and
&lt;math&gt;\theta = 0&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to a left-handed helicoid.

      <text bytes="28527" xml:space="preserve">A '''schema for horizontal dials''' is a set of instructions used to construct horizontal [[sundial]]s using [[compass and straightedge construction]] techniques, which were widely used in Europe from the late fifteenth century to the late nineteenth century. The common [[London dial|horizontal sundial]] is a geometric [[Graphical projection|projection]] of an [[equatorial sundial]] onto a horizontal plane.

The special properties of the [[polar-pointing gnomon]] (axial gnomon) were first known to the Moorish astronomer [[Abdul Hassan Ali]] in the early thirteenth century{{sfn|BSS Glossary|1}} and this led the way to the dial-plates, with which we are familiar, dial plates where the style and hour lines have a common root.

Through the centuries artisans have used different methods to markup the hour lines sundials using the methods that were familiar to them, in addition the topic has fascinated mathematicians and become a topic of study. Graphical projection was once commonly taught, though this has been superseded by [[trigonometry]], [[logarithms]], [[sliderule]]s and [[computer applications|computers]] which made [[arithmetic|arithmetical calculations]] increasingly trivial/ Graphical projection was once the mainstream method for laying out a sundial but has been sidelined and is now only of academic interest.

The first known document in English describing a schema for graphical projection was published in Scotland in 1440, leading to a series of distinct schema for horizontal dials each with characteristics that suited the target [[latitude]] and construction method of the time.

==Context==
[[File:The Ummayad Mosque also known as the Grand Mosque of Damascus.jpg|thumb|Umayyad Mosque, also known as the Grand Mosque of Damascus]]
The art of sundial design is to produce a dial that accurately displays local time. Sundial designers have also been fascinated by the mathematics of the dial and possible new ways of displaying the information. Modern dialling started in the tenth century when Arab astronomers made the great discovery that a gnomon parallel to the Earth's axis will produce sundials whose hour lines show [[equal hour]]s or ''legal hours'' on any day of the year: the dial of [[Ibn al-Shatir]] in the [[Umayyad Mosque]] in [[Damascus]] is the oldest dial of this type. {{efn|Time had been measured by dividing the daylight hours by twelve using ''unequal hours'', known as [[Italian hours]] or [[Babylonian hours]].}} Dials of this type appeared in Austria and Germany in the 1440s.{{sfn|Jones|1980|p=6}}

A dial plate can be laid out, by a pragmatic approach, observing and marking a shadow at regular intervals throughout the day on each day of the year. If the [[latitude]] is known the dial plate can be laid out using [[Compass-and-straightedge construction|geometrical construction techniques]] which rely on [[graphical projection|projection geometry]], or by calculation using the known formulas and [[trigonometric tables]] usually using [[logarithms]], or [[slide rule]]s or more recently [[computer application|computer]]s or [[mobile phone application|mobile phone]]s. [[Linear algebra]] has provided a useful language to describe the [[mathematical transformation|transformation]]s.

A sundial schema uses a [[Compass-and-straightedge construction|compass and a straight edge]] to firstly to derive the essential angles for that latitude, then to use this to draw the hourlines on the dial plate. In modern terminology this would mean that graphical techniques were used to derive &lt;math&gt; \sin x &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; m\tan y &lt;/math&gt; and from it &lt;math&gt; \sin x .\tan y &lt;/math&gt;. {{efn|The British Sundial Society publishes a glossary of computer terms and the symbols that are commonly used to represent them. Latitude is represented by ''phi'',&lt;math&gt;\phi &lt;/math&gt; or ''φ'' or Φ.}}

===Basic calculation===
*Using a large sheet of paper.
*Starting at the bottom a horizontal line is drawn, and a vertical one up the centre. Where they cross is becomes the origin O, the foot of the Gnomon.
*A horizontal line draw a line which fixes the size of the dial. Where it crosses the centre line is an important construction point F
*A construction line is drawn upwards from O at the angle of latitude.{{efn|All dials in these illustrations use a latitude of 52°, it was chosen randomly but is roughly that of [[Bletchley Park]], [[Den Haag]] or [[Bielefeld]].}}
*Using a square, (drop a line)  a line from F through the construction line is drawn so they cross at right angles. That point E, is an important construction point. To be precise it is the line FE that is important as it is length &lt;math&gt;\sin\phi &lt;/math&gt;.
*Using compasses, or dividers the length FE was copied upwards in the centre line from F. The new construction point is called G The construction lines and FE are erased.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Such geometric constructions were well known and remained part of the high school (UK grammar school) curriculum until the [[New Math]]s revolution in the 1970s.{{sfn|Durell|1921}}

The schema shown above was used in 1525 (from an earlier work 1440) by [[Dürer]] is still used today. The simpler schema were more suitable for dials designed for the lower latitudes, requiring a narrow sheet of paper for the construction,  than those intended for the higher latitudes. This prompted the quest for other constructions.

==Horizontal dials==
The first part of the process is common to many methods. It establishes a point on the north south line that is sin φ from the meridian line.

===Early Scottish method (1440) Dürer (1525) Rohr (1965) ===
*Start with the basic method shown above
*From G a series of lines, 15° apart are drawn, long enough so they cross the line through F. These mark the hour points 1, 2, 3 4, 5 and 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
*The centre of the dial is at the bottom, point O. The line drawn from each of these hour point to O will be the hour line on the finished dial.{{sfn|Waugh|1973|pp=38–39}}
The significant problem is the width of the paper needed in the higher latitudes. {{sfn|Sawyer|191}}

===Benedetti (1574)===
Benedetti, an impoverished nobleman worked as a mathematician at the court of Savola. His book which describes this method was ''De gnomonum umbrarumque solarium usu'' published in 1574. It describes a method for displaying the legal hours, that is equal hours as we use today, while most people still used unequal hours which divided the hours of daylight into 12 equal hours- but they would change as the year progressed. Benedettis method divides the quadrant into 15° segments. Two construction are made: a parallel horizontal line that defines the tan h distances, and a gnomonic polar line GT which represents sin φ. 
* Draw a quadrant GRB, with 15° segments. GR is horizontal. 
* A parallel horizontal line is drawn from PE, and ticks made where it bisects the 15° rays. 
* GX is the latitude. T is the crossing point with PE. GTE is the gnomonic triangle.
* The length GT is copied to the bottom of E giving the point F. 
* The hour lines are drawn from F, and the dial is complete.
Benedetti included instructions for drawing a point gnomon so unequal hours could be plotted.

===Clavius method (1586)===
(''Fabica et usus instrumenti ad horologiorum descriptionem.'') Rome Italy.

The Clavius method looks at a quarter of the dial. It views the horizontal and the perpendicular plane to the polar axis as two rectangles hinged around the top edge of both dials. the polar axis will be at φ degrees to the polar axis, and the hour lines will be equispaced on the polar plane an equatorial dial. (15°). Hour points on the polar plane will connect to the matching point on the horizontal plane. The horizontal hour lines are plotted to the origin.

{{sfn|Gunella|2013}}
*Draw the gnomomic triangle, lying on it hypotenuse.
*On the small side, draw a (equatorial) square, with 15° hour markings.
*The dial plate is constructed with compasses taking it sizes from the triangle.
*The hour lines 12, 3, and 6 are known. The hour lines 1 and 2 are taken from the side of the square.
*A diagonal is taken from 12 to 6, and lines parallel to this drawn through 1 and 2, giving 5 and 4
*The morning dial is a reflection of this.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Stirrup's method (1652)===
*From G a series of lines, 15° apart are drawn, long enough so they cross the line through F. These mark the hour points 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3.
*The centre of the dial is at the bottom, point O. The line drawn from each of these hour point to O will be the hour line on the finished dial.
&lt;!--*If the paper is large enough, the method above works from 7 until 12, and 12 until 5 and the values before and after 6 are calculated through symmetry. However, there is another way of marking up 7 and 8, and 4 and 5. Call the point where 3 crosses the line R, and a drop a line at right-angles to the base line. Call that point W. Use a construction line to join W and F. Waugh calls the crossing points with the hours lines K, L, M.
*Using compasses or dividers, add two more points to this line N and P, so that the distances MN = ML, and MP = MK. The missing hour lines are drawn from O through N and through P. The construction lines are erased.--&gt;{{sfn|Sawyer|191}}

===Bettini method (1660)===
The [[Jesuit]] [[Bettinus|Mario Bettini]] penned a method which was posthumously  published in the book ''Recreationum Mathematicarum Apiaria Novissima'' 1660.
*Draw the gnomonic triangle with the hypotenuse against the ''meridian'' line, and φ to the bottom, C. The other point call M, the right angle call G.
*A horizontal line is drawn through M, this is the ''equinoctial''
*A circle centred an M with a radius MG is drawn. G2 and G3 are the intersections of the circle and meridian.
*In the top quadrants, points are marked each 30°. Two are named P, Q. 
*Construction lines are drawn from G2 and G3 through P and Q- the intersections with the equinoctial are marked.
*To finish the hourlines are drawn through these points from C, and the dial squared off.

===Leybourn (1669)===
[[William Leybourn]] published his "''Art of Dialling''"{{efn|The Art of Dialling : Performed Geometrically, by Scale and Compasses: Arithmetically, by the Canons of Sines and Tangents: Instrumentally, by a Trigonal Instrument ... ; To which is added A Supplement; Shewing, How by Scale and Compasses to inscribe such Circles of the Sphere into Sun-Dial-Plans, that shall shew (besides the hour of the day) the Diurnal Motion of the Sun ...}} in 1669, a with it a six-stage method. His description relies heavily on the term ''[[Scale of chords|line of chords]]'', for which a modern diallist substitutes a [[protractor]]. The line of chords was a scale found on the [[Sector (instrument)|sector]] which was used in conjunction with a set of dividers or compasses. It was still used by navigators up to the end of the 19th century.{{efn|The line of chords is available on a builders metal rule (Stanley 60R Line of Chords Rule) in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://metal.brightcookie.com/shared/toolbook/tool_46.htm&lt;/ref&gt; }}
*Draw a circle, and its two cardinal diameters: E–W, and S–N (top to bottom). O is their crossing point or origin.
*Using a [[scale of chords]] or protractor, lay off two lines, ''"0a"'' that is 52° from  OS, and ''"0b"'' that is 52° from OW. (they will be at right angles. The points "a" and "b" are important.
*With a straight edge draw a line connect E with "a", it cuts SN (the meridian line) at P, which is called the ''pole of the world''. Now connect E to "a", it connects AE. This point is important as it is where the ''meridian crosses the equinoctial circle''. The points E, AE, and W lie on the equinoctial circle. The next task is to use this information to locate the centre and to draw the circle. Use a construction line to join AE and W. At the centre point, raise a line at right angles. Where it cuts the SN (the meridian) will be C, the centre of the equinoctial circle. Use C to draw an arc from E to W, it will pass through AE.
* There is now a semicircle passing through E and W, and the equinoctial arc passing through E and W. Divide the semicircle into 12 equal parts, i.e. 15° angles. Mark with a "construction point". {{efn|This can be done using the line of chords set at 60° and subdividing.}}
* A ruler joins O with the points on the semicircle. These lines cut the equinoctial arc: a series of unequal points ("markers) are created.
* A ruler from P (the pole of the world) takes a line from these markers back over the semicircle. Where it cuts it will be the "hour point"; these hour points are unequally spaced.
* The  hour lines are drawn from each of these "hour points" to O the origin. The origin is the foot of the style which is cut at 52°. {{sfn|Leybourn|1700}}{{sfn|Sawyer|191}}

===Ozanam's method (1673) Mayall (1938)===
This method requires a far smaller piece of paper,{{sfn|Sawyer|191}} a great advantage for higher latitudes.

*From G a series of lines, 15° apart are drawn, long enough so they cross the line through F. These mark the hour points 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3 and represent the points &lt;math&gt;\tan h \sin\phi &lt;/math&gt;.  
*The centre of the dial is at the bottom, point O. The line drawn from each of these hour point to O will be the hour line on the finished dial.{{sfn|Waugh|1973|pp=38–39}}
*The lines through 9 and 3 are extended to the WE line and a line dropped orthogonally from 9 and 3 to the WE line, call the crossing points W' and E'. From W and E two more lines are drawn 15° apart, these cut the verticals creating the hour points 7, 8 and 4, 5. Lines taken from 0 to these hour points are the hour lines on the final dial.

===Encyclopedia method (1771)===
This method uses the properties of chords to establish distance &lt;math&gt; m. \sin \theta &lt;/math&gt; in the top quadrant, and then transfers this distance into the bottom quadrant so that &lt;math&gt;\sin \phi \sin \theta &lt;/math&gt; is established. Again, a transfer of this measure to the chords in the top quadrant. The final lines establish the formula &lt;math&gt;\tan \kappa =&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \sin\theta\sin\phi\over\cos\theta&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\tan\theta\sin\phi &lt;/math&gt;

This is then transferred by symmetry to all quadrants. It was used in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica#1768–1826|Encyclopædia Britannica]] First Edition 1771, Sixth Edition 1823{{sfn|Sawyer|193|p=36}}

*The gnomon is drawn first against the north–south line. In doing so, a diameter at ''φ'' degrees to the vertical is drawn; its reflection will also be needed.
*The circumference is marked off at 15° intervals in the top quadrants. Chords parallel to the horizontal are drawn (the length of these chords will be sin Θ.
*The measurement of each chord is transferred to form a scale along the lower radiuses. When joined these points form a series of parallel lines that are sin θ. sin φ in length.
*These measurements are transferred up to the chord.
*The final hour lines are drawn from the origins through these crossing points. ( &lt;math&gt;\tan \kappa =&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \sin\theta\sin\phi\over\cos\theta&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\tan\theta\sin\phi &lt;/math&gt; ){{sfn|Sawyer|193|p=37}}

===de Celles (1760) (1790) Waugh method (1973)===
The [[Dom Bédos de Celles|Dom Francois Bedos de Celles]] method (1760) {{sfn|Bédos de Celles|1760|p=58}} otherwise known as the Waugh method (1973) {{sfn|Waugh|1973|p=38}}{{sfn|Sawyer|191}}

*From G a series of lines, 15° apart are drawn, long enough so they cross the line through F. These mark the hour points 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3 if you take just 3 and represent the points &lt;math&gt;\tan h \sin\phi &lt;/math&gt;.
*The centre of the dial is at the bottom, point O. The line drawn from each of these hour point to O will be the hour line on the finished dial.{{sfn|Waugh|1973|pp=38–39}}
*If the paper is large enough, the method above works from 7 until 12, and 12 until 5 and the values before and after 6 are calculated through symmetry. However, there is another way of marking up 7 and 8, and 4 and 5. Call the point where 3 crosses the line R, and a drop a line at right-angles to the base line. Call that point W. Use a construction line to join W and F. Waugh calls the crossing points with the hours lines K, L, M.
*Using compasses or dividers, add two more points to this line N and P, so that the distances MN = ML, and MP = MK. The missing hour lines are drawn from O through N and through P. The construction lines are erased.{{sfn|Waugh|1973|pp=38–39}} {{sfn|Sawyer|191}}

===Nicholson's method (1825)===
This method first appeared in Peter Nicholsons ''A popular Course of Pure and Mixed Mathematics'' in 1825. It was copied by School World in Jun 1903, then in Kenneth Lynch's, Sundial and Spheres 1971. {{sfn|Sawyer|194}} It starts by drawing the well known triangle, and takes the vertices to draw two circles at radius (OB) sin φ and (AB) tan φ. The 15° lines are drawn, intersecting these circles. Lines are taken horizontally, and vertically from these circles and their intersection point (OB sin t,AB cos t) is on the hour line. That is tan κ = OB sin t/ AB cos t which resolves to sin φ. tan t.

*Draw the NS line, and the EW line crossing at the origin O. At a convenient point in the first quadrant join the axes with a line set at the target angle. This forms the basic triangle OAB.
*Set the compasses at length OB and inscribe a circle. Set the compasses on AB and inscribe a concentric circle. On both of these circles mark out the 15° angles.
*Taking the lines vertically from the inner circle, and horizontally from the outer circle, Mark each of the intersections. These are on the hour lines.
*Connect the intersection points to the origin.

===Foster Serles Dialling Scales (1638)===
{{see|Dialing scales}}
* A right-angle is drawn on the dial-face and the latitude scale is laid against the ''x''-axis. 
* The target latitude point is marked across on to the dial face. The hour scale is placed from this point to the noon line (conventionally, the zero point is on the noon line). 
* Each of the hour points is copied over to the dial face, and this procedure is repeated, giving the hours both sides of noon. A straight edge is used to connect these points to the origin, thus drawing the hour lines for that location. 
* A vertical line from the target latitude point, and a horizontal line through the noon point will bisect at the three-hour (9am–3pm) marker. 
* The style will be at the same angle as the latitude.

===Saphea (As-Saphiah)===
This was an early and convenient method to use if you had access to an [[astrolabe]] as many [[astrologer]]s and [[mathematician]]s of the time would have had. The method involved copying the projections of the [[celestial sphere]] onto a plane surface. A vertical line was drawn with a line at the angle of the latitude drawn on the bisection of the vertical with the celestial sphere. {{sfn|Gunella|2013c}}

Throughout history, [[angle]]s have been [[measure (mathematics)|measured]] in many different [[unit (measurement)|units]]. These are known as '''angular units''', with the most contemporary units being the [[degree (angle)|degree]] ( ° ), the [[radian]] (rad), and the [[gradian]] (grad), though many others have been used throughout [[History of Mathematics|history]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2020-04-17|title=List of Geometry and Trigonometry Symbols|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/geometry-trigonometry-symbols/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-08-31|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=angular unit|url=https://www.thefreedictionary.com/angular+unit|access-date=2020-08-31|website=TheFreeDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this page is to aggregate other concepts pertaining to the '''angular unit''', where additional explanation can be provided.

==Angle measurement in general==
The size of a geometric angle is usually characterized by the magnitude of the smallest rotation that maps one of the rays into the other. Angles that have the same size are said to be ''equal'', ''congruent,'' or ''equal in measure''.

In some contexts, such as identifying a point on a circle or describing the ''orientation'' of an object in two dimensions relative to a reference orientation, angles that differ by an exact multiple of a full [[Turn (geometry)|turn]] are effectively equivalent.  In other contexts, such as identifying a point on a [[spiral]] curve, or describing the ''cumulative rotation'' of an object in two dimensions relative to a reference orientation, angles that differ by a non-zero multiple of a full turn are not equivalent.

In order to measure an angle &lt;var&gt;[[theta|θ]]&lt;/var&gt;, a [[circular arc]] centered at the vertex of the angle is drawn (e.g. with a pair of [[Compasses (drafting)|compasses]]). The ratio of the length &lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt; of the arc by the radius &lt;var&gt;r&lt;/var&gt; of the circle is the measure of the angle in [[radian]]s.

The measure of the angle in another angular unit is then obtained by multiplying its measure in radians by the scaling factor {{sfrac|''k''|2{{pi}}}}, where ''k'' is the measure of a complete turn in the chosen unit (for example, 360 for [[degree (angle)|degrees]] or 400 for [[gradian]]s):

:&lt;math&gt; \theta = k \frac{s}{2\pi r}. &lt;/math&gt;

The value of &lt;var&gt;θ&lt;/var&gt; thus defined is independent of the size of the circle: if the length of the radius is changed, then the arc length changes in the same proportion, so the ratio ''s''/''r'' is unaltered. (Proof. The formula above can be rewritten as {{nowrap|1 = ''k'' = {{sfrac|''θr''|''s''}}.}} One turn, for which {{nowrap|1 = ''θ'' = ''n''}} units, corresponds to an arc equal in length to the circle's [[circumference]], which is 2{{math|π}}''r'', so {{nowrap|1 = ''s'' = 2{{math|π}}''r''}}. Substituting ''n'' for ''θ'' and 2{{math|π}}''r'' for ''s'' in the formula, results in {{nowrap|1 = ''k'' = {{sfrac|''nr''|2{{math|π}}''r''}} = {{sfrac|''n''|2{{math|π}}}}.}}) {{refn|group="nb"|This approach requires however an additional proof that the measure of the angle does not change with changing radius &lt;var&gt;r&lt;/var&gt;, in addition to the issue of "measurement units chosen." A smoother approach is to measure the angle by the length of the corresponding unit circle arc. Here "unit" can be chosen to be dimensionless in the sense that it is the real number 1 associated with the unit segment on the real line. See Radoslav M. Dimitrić for instance.&lt;ref name="Dimitric_2012"/&gt;}}

In particular, the measure of angle is radian can be also interpreted as the arc length of its corresponding unit circle:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|title=Radian|url=https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Radian.html|access-date=2020-08-31|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Angle addition postulate===
The angle addition postulate states that if B is in the interior of angle AOC, then

&lt;math&gt; m\angle AOC = m\angle AOB + m\angle BOC &lt;/math&gt;

The measure of the angle AOC is the sum of the measure of angle AOB and the measure of angle BOC.
In this postulate, it does not matter in which [[Units of measurement|unit]] the angle is measured—as long as each angle is measured in the same unit.

==Units==
[[Image:Angle radian.svg|right|thumb|150 px|Definition of 1 radian]]

One ''[[radian]]'' is the angle subtended by an arc of a circle that has the same length as the circle's radius. The radian is the derived quantity of angular measurement in the [[SI]] system. By definition, it is [[dimensionless]], though it may be specified as ''rad'' to avoid ambiguity. Angles measured in [[degree symbol|degree]]s, are shown with the symbol °. Subdivisions of the degree are [[Minute and second of arc|minute]] (symbol ′, 1′ = 1/60°) and [[Minute and second of arc|second]] {symbol ″, 1″ = 1/3600°}.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An angle of 360° corresponds to the angle subtended by a full circle, and is equal to 2π radians, or 400 gradians.

Other units used to represent angles are listed in the following table. These units are defined such that the number of [[Turn (geometry)|turn]]s is equivalent to a full circle.

|-
|[[turn (geometry)|Turn]]||1||360° || The ''turn'', also ''cycle'', ''full circle'', ''revolution'', and ''rotation'', is complete circular movement or measure (as to return to the same point) with circle or ellipse.  A turn is abbreviated {{mvar|&amp;tau;}}, ''cyc'', ''rev'', or ''rot'' depending on the application.. The symbol {{mvar|&amp;tau;}} can also be used as a [[mathematical constant]] to represent 2{{pi}} radians.

|[[circular sector|Quadrant]]||4||90°||One ''quadrant'' is also known as a ''[[right angle]]''. The quadrant is the unit used in [[Euclid's Elements]]. In German the symbol &lt;sup&gt;∟&lt;/sup&gt; has been used to denote a quadrant.
|-
|[[circular sector|Sextant]]||6||60°||The ''sextant'' was the unit used by the [[Babylonians]],&lt;ref name="Jeans_1947"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Murnaghan_1946"/&gt; The degree, minute of arc and second of arc are [[sexagesimal]] subunits of the Babylonian unit. It is especially easy to construct with ruler and compasses.
|-
|[[Radian]]||2π||57°17′||The ''radian'' is determined by the circumference of a circle that is equal in length to the radius of the circle.
|-
| Hexacontade||60 ||6°||The ''hexacontade'' is a unit used by [[Eratosthenes]].
|-
|[[Binary scaling#Binary angles|Binary degree]] ||256||1°33'45"  || The ''binary degree'', also known as the ''[[binary radian]]'' (or ''brad'').&lt;ref name="ooPIC"/&gt; The binary degree is used in computing so that an angle can be efficiently represented in a single [[byte]] (albeit to limited precision). Other measures of angle used in computing may be based on dividing one whole turn into 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; equal parts for other values of ''n''.
&lt;ref name="Hargreaves_2010"/&gt;
|-
|[[degree (angle)|Degree]] ||360 ||1°|| One advantage of this old [[sexagesimal]] subunit is that many angles common in simple geometry are measured as a whole number of degrees. Fractions of a degree may be written in normal decimal notation (e.g. 3.5° for three and a half degrees), but the "minute" and "second" sexagesimal subunits of the "degree-minute-second" system are also in use, especially for [[Geographic coordinate system|geographical coordinates]] and in [[astronomy]] and [[ballistics]]
|-
| [[grad (angle)|Grad]]||400 ||0°54′ || The ''grad'', also called ''grade'', ''gradian'', or ''gon''. a right angle is 100 grads. It is a decimal subunit of the quadrant. A [[kilometre]] was historically defined as a [[centi]]-grad of arc along a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] of the Earth, so the kilometer is the decimal analog to the [[sexagesimal]] [[nautical mile]]. The grad is used mostly in [[triangulation]].
|-
| [[Minute of arc]]||21,600 ||0°1′|| The ''minute of arc'' (or ''MOA'', ''arcminute'', or just ''minute'') is {{sfrac|60}} of a degree. A [[nautical mile]] was historically defined as a minute of arc along a [[great circle]] of the Earth.
|-
| [[Second of arc]]||1,296,000 ||0°0′1″||The ''second of arc'' (or ''arcsecond'', or just ''second'') is {{sfrac|60}} of a minute of arc and {{sfrac|3600}} of a degree.

===Other descriptors===
* [[Tau]], the number of radians in one [[Turn (geometry)|turn]] (1 turn = {{tau}} rad), {{tau}} = 2{{pi}}.
* Chi, an old Chinese angle measurement.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}
* Diameter part (''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;376.99...): The ''diameter part'' (occasionally used in Islamic mathematics) is {{sfrac|60}} radian. One "diameter part" is approximately 0.95493°. There are about 376.991 diameter parts per turn.
* [[Milliradian]] and derived definitions: The true milliradian is defined a thousandth of a radian, which means that a rotation of one [[Turn (geometry)|turn]] would equal exactly 2000π mil (or approximately 6283.185 mil), and almost all [[Telescopic sight|scope sights]] for [[firearm]]s are calibrated to this definition. In addition there are three other derived definitions used for artillery and navigation which are ''approximately'' equal to a milliradian. Under these three other definitions one turn makes up for exactly 6000, 6300 or 6400 mils, which equals spanning the range from 0.05625 to 0.06 degrees (3.375 to 3.6 minutes). In comparison, the true milliradian is approximately 0.05729578 degrees (3.43775 minutes). One "[[NATO]] mil" is defined as {{sfrac|6400}} of a circle. Just like with the true milliradian, each of the other definitions exploits the mil's useful property of subtensions, i.e. that the value of one milliradian approximately equals the angle subtended by a width of 1 meter as seen from 1&amp;nbsp;km away ({{sfrac|2{{pi}}|6400}} = 0.0009817… ≈ {{sfrac|1000}}).
* Akhnam and zam. In old Arabia a [[Turn (geometry)|turn]] was subdivided in 32 Akhnam and each akhnam was subdivided in 7 zam, so that a [[Turn (geometry)|turn]] is 224 zam.

==Positive and negative angles==
Although the definition of the measurement of an angle does not support the concept of a negative angle, it is frequently useful to impose a convention that allows positive and negative angular values to represent orientations, and rotations in opposite directions relative to some reference.

In a two-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system]], an angle is typically defined by its two sides, with its vertex at the origin. The ''initial side'' is on the positive [[x-axis]], while the other side (i.e., the ''terminal side'') is defined by the measure from the initial side in radians, degrees, or turns. Typically, ''positive angles'' represent rotations toward the positive [[y-axis]], and ''negative angles'' represent rotations toward the negative y-axis.  When Cartesian coordinates are represented by ''standard position'', defined by the x-axis rightward and the y-axis upward, positive rotations are [[anticlockwise]], and negative rotations are [[clockwise]].

In many contexts, an angle of −''θ'' is effectively equivalent to an angle of "one full turn minus ''θ''". For example, an orientation represented as &amp;nbsp;−45° is effectively equivalent to an orientation represented as 360°&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;45° or 315°.  However, a rotation of &amp;nbsp;−45° would not be the same as a rotation of 315°.

In three-dimensional geometry, "clockwise" and "anticlockwise" have no absolute meaning, so the direction of positive and negative angles must be defined relative to some reference, which is typically a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] passing through the angle's vertex, and which is perpendicular to the plane in which the rays of the angle lie.

In [[navigation]], [[bearing (navigation)|bearings]] are measured relative to north. By convention, viewed from above, bearing angle are positive clockwise, so a bearing of 45° corresponds to a north-east orientation. Negative bearings are not used in navigation, so a north-west orientation corresponds to a bearing of 315°.

==Alternative ways of measuring the size of an angle==
There are several alternatives to measuring the size of an angle by the corresponding angle of rotation.
The ''[[grade (slope)|grade of a slope]]'', or ''gradient'', is equal to the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangent]] of the angle, or sometimes (rarely) the [[sine]]. Gradients are often expressed as a percentage. For very small values (less than 5%), the grade of a slope is approximately the measure of an angle in radians.

In [[rational geometry]], the ''spread'' between two lines is defined at the square of sine of the angle between the lines. Since the sine of an angle and the sine of its supplementary angle are the same, any angle of rotation that maps one of the lines into the other leads to the same value of the spread between the lines.

===Astronomical approximations===
Astronomers measure angular separation of objects in degrees from their point of observation.
* 0.5° is approximately the width of the sun or moon.
* 1° is approximately the width of a little finger at arm's length.
* 10° is approximately the width of a closed fist at arm's length.
* 20° is approximately the width of a handspan at arm's length.

These measurements clearly depend on the individual subject, and the above should be treated as rough [[rule of thumb]] approximations only.

==Measurements that are not angular units==
Not all angle measurements are angular units, for an angular measurement, it is definitional that the [[angle addition postulate]] holds.

Some angle measurements where the [[angle addition postulate]] does not hold include:

* [[Trigonometric functions]]
* [[Slope]]

A '''biconcave disc''' — also referred to as a '''discocyte'''&lt;ref name="kuchelfackerell"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kuchel |first1=Philip W. |last2=Fackerell |first2=Edward D. |year=1999 |title=Parametric-equation representation of biconcave erythrocytes |journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biology |language=en |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=209–220 |doi=10.1006/bulm.1998.0064 |pmid=17883208 |s2cid=39585695 |issn=1522-9602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; — is a geometric shape resembling an [[oblate spheroid]] with two [[Concavity|concavities]] on the top and on the bottom.

Biconcave discs appear in the study of [[cell biology]], where it is [[meta-stable]], and involves the continuous adjustment of the asymmetric transbilayer lipid distribution, which is correlated with [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] depletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Pages |first1=Guilhem |last2=Yau |first2=Tsz W. |last3=Kuchel |first3=Philip W. |date=2010 |title=Erythrocyte shape reversion from echinocytes to discocytes: Kinetics via fast-measurement NMR diffusion-diffraction |journal=Magnetic Resonance in Medicine |language=en |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=645–652 |doi=10.1002/mrm.22457 |pmid=20806372 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical model==

A biconcave disc can be described mathematically by
:&lt;math&gt;z(r) = D \sqrt{1 - \frac{4r^2}{D^2}} \left(a_0 + \frac{a_1 r^2}{D^2} + \frac{a_2 r^4}{D^4} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|z(r)}} is the height of the surface as a function of radius {{math|r}}, {{math|D}} is the diameter of the disc, and {{math|a_0, a_1, a_2}} are coefficients describing the shape.  The above model describes a smooth surface; actual cells can be much more irregular.

      <text bytes="6020" xml:space="preserve">The '''geometric set cover problem''' is the special case of the [[set cover problem]] in geometric settings. The input is a range space &lt;math&gt;\Sigma = (X, \mathcal{R})&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Universe (mathematics)|universe]] of points in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a family of subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; called ''ranges'', defined by the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and geometric shapes such as disks and axis-parallel rectangles. The goal is to select a ''minimum-size'' subset &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; of ranges such that every point in the universe &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is covered by some range in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

Given the same range space &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, a closely related problem is the '''geometric hitting set problem''', where the goal is to select a ''minimum-size'' subset &lt;math&gt;H \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; of points such that every range of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; has nonempty intersection with &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., is ''hit'' by &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.

In the one-dimensional case, where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; contains points on the [[real line]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by intervals, both the geometric set cover and hitting set problems can be solved in [[Time complexity|polynomial time]] using a simple [[greedy algorithm]]. However, in higher dimensions, they are known to be [[NP-completeness|NP-complete]] even for simple shapes, i.e., when &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; is induced by unit disks or unit squares.&lt;ref name="npc"&gt;{{Citation

Many [[approximation algorithm]]s have been devised for these problems. Due to the geometric nature, the approximation ratios for these problems can be much better than the general set cover/hitting set problems. Moreover, these approximate solutions can even be computed in near-linear time.&lt;ref name="AP14"&gt;

==Approximation algorithms==

The [[set cover problem#greedy algorithm|greedy algorithm]] for the general set cover problem gives &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt; approximation, where &lt;math&gt;n = \max\{|X|, |\mathcal{R}|\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The approximation ratio can be further improved to &lt;math&gt;O(\log \log \mathsf{OPT})&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; is induced by axis-parallel rectangles or disks in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.

[[Image:Sphere and Ball.png|right|thumb|A [[sphere]] is the surface of a solid [[ball (mathematics)|ball]], here having [[radius]] ''r'']]
In [[mathematics]], a '''surface''' is a generalization of a [[plane (geometry)|plane]], which is not necessarily flat – that is, the [[surface curvature|curvature]] is not necessarily zero. This is analogous to a [[curve]] generalizing a [[straight line]]. There are many more precise definitions, depending on the context and the mathematical tools that are used to analyze the surface.

The mathematical concept of a surface is an idealization of what is meant by ''surface'' in [[science]], [[computer graphics]], and common language.

==Definitions==
Often, a surface is defined by [[equation]]s that are satisfied by the [[coordinate]]s of its points. This is the case of the [[graph of a function|graph]] of a [[continuous function]] of two variables. The set of the [[zero of a function|zeros of a function]] of three variables is a surface, which is called an [[implicit surface]].&lt;ref&gt;Here "implicit" does not refer to a property of the surface, which may be defined by other means, but instead to how it is defined. Thus this term is an abbreviation of "surface defined by an [[implicit equation]]".&lt;/ref&gt; If the defining three-variate function is a [[polynomial]], the surface is an [[algebraic surface]]. For example, the [[unit sphere]] is an algebraic surface, as it may be defined by the [[implicit equation]]
:&lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2+z^2 -1= 0.&lt;/math&gt;

A surface may also be defined as the [[Image (mathematics)|image]], in some space of [[dimension]] at least 3, of a [[continuous function]] of two variables (some further conditions are required to insure that the image is not a [[curve]]). In this case, one says that one has a [[parametric surface]], which is ''parametrized'' by these two variables, called ''parameters''. For example, the unit sphere may be parametrized by the [[Euler angles]], also called [[longitude]] {{mvar|u}} and [[latitude]] {{mvar|v}} by 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
x&amp;= \cos(u)\cos(v)\\
y&amp;=\sin(u)\cos(v)\\
z&amp;=\sin(v)\,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Parametric equations of surfaces are often irregular at some points. For example, all but two points of the unit sphere, are the image, by the above parametrization, of exactly one pair of Euler angles ([[modulo operation|modulo]] {{math|2{{pi}}}}). For the remaining two points (the [[North Pole|north]] and [[South Pole|south poles]]), one has {{math|1=cos ''v'' = 0}}, and the longitude {{math|''u''}} may take any values. Also, there are surfaces for which there cannot exist a single parametrization that covers the whole surface. Therefore, one often considers surfaces which are parametrized by several parametric equations, whose images cover the surface. This is formalized by the concept of [[manifold]]: in the context of manifolds, typically in [[topology]] and [[differential geometry]], a surface is a manifold of dimension two; this means that a surface is a [[topological space]] such that every point has a [[neighborhood]] which is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to an [[open subset]] of the [[Euclidean plane]] (see [[Surface (topology)]] and [[Surface (differential geometry)]]). This allows defining surfaces in spaces of dimension higher than three, and even ''abstract surfaces'', which are not contained in any other space. On the other hand, this excludes surfaces that have [[singularity theory|singularities]], such as the vertex of a [[conical surface]] or points where a surface crosses itself.

In [[classical geometry]], a surface is generally defined as a [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of a point or a line. For example, a [[sphere]] is the locus of a point which is at a given distance of a fixed point, called the center; a [[conical surface]] is the locus of a line passing through a fixed point and crossing a [[curve]]; a [[surface of revolution]] is the locus of a curve rotating around a line. A [[ruled surface]] is the locus of a moving line satisfying some constraints; in modern terminology, a ruled surface is a surface, which is a [[union (set theory)|union]] of lines.

==Terminology==
In this article, several kinds of surfaces are considered and compared. An unambiguous terminology is thus necessary to distinguish them. Therefore, we call [[#Topological surface|topological surfaces]] the surfaces that are [[manifold]]s of dimension two (the surfaces considered in [[Surface (topology)]]). We call [[#Differentiable surface|differentiable surfaces]] the surfaces that are [[differentiable manifold]]s (the surfaces considered in [[Surface (differential geometry)]]). Every differentiable surface is a topological surface, but the converse is false.

For simplicity, unless otherwise stated, "surface" will mean a surface in the [[Euclidean space]] of dimension 3 or in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. A surface that is not supposed to be included in another space is called an '''abstract surface'''.

==Examples==
* The [[graph of a function|graph]] of a [[continuous function]] of two variables, defined over a [[connected space|connected]] [[open subset]] of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is a ''topological surface''. If the function is [[differentiable function|differentiable]], the graph is a ''differentiable surface''.
* A [[plane (geometry)|plane]] is both an [[algebraic surface]] and a differentiable surface. It is also a [[ruled surface]] and a [[surface of revolution]].
* A [[circular cylinder]] (that is, the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of a line crossing a circle and parallel to a given direction) is an algebraic surface and a differentiable surface.
* A [[conical surface|circular cone]] (locus of a line crossing a circle, and passing through a fixed point, the ''apex'', which is outside the plane of the circle) is an algebraic surface which is not a differentiable surface. If one removes the apex, the remainder of the cone is the union of two differentiable surfaces. 
* The surface of a [[polyhedron]] is a topological surface, which is neither a differentiable surface nor an algebraic surface.
* A [[hyperbolic paraboloid]] (the graph of the function {{math|1=''z'' = ''xy''}}) is a differentiable surface and an algebraic surface. It is also a ruled surface, and, for this reason, is often used in [[architecture]].
* A [[two-sheet hyperboloid]] is an algebraic surface and the union of two non-intersecting differentiable surfaces.

==Parametric surface==
{{main|Parametric surface}}
A '''parametric surface''' is the image of an open subset of the [[Euclidean plane]] (typically &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^2&lt;/math&gt;) by a [[continuous function]], in a [[topological space]], generally a [[Euclidean space]] of dimension at least three. Usually the function is supposed to be [[continuously differentiable]], and this will be always the case in this article.

Specifically, a parametric surface in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^3&lt;/math&gt; is given by three functions of two variables {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}}, called ''parameters''
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
x&amp;=f_1(u,v)\\
y&amp;=f_2(u,v)\\
z&amp;=f_3(u,v)\,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

As the image of such a function may be a [[curve]] (for example, if the three functions are constant with respect to {{mvar|v}}), a further condition is required, generally that, for [[almost all]] values of the parameters, the [[Jacobian matrix]] 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
\dfrac{\partial f_1}{\partial u} &amp; \dfrac{\partial f_1}{\partial v}\\
\dfrac{\partial f_2}{\partial u} &amp; \dfrac{\partial f_2}{\partial v}\\
\dfrac{\partial f_3}{\partial u} &amp; \dfrac{\partial f_3}{\partial v}\\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
has [[rank of a matrix|rank]] two. Here "almost all" means that the values of the parameters where the rank is two contain a [[dense subset|dense]] [[open subset]] of the range of the parametrization. For surfaces in a space of higher dimension, the condition is the same, except for the number of columns of the Jacobian matrix.

===Tangent plane and normal vector===
A point {{mvar|p}} where the above Jacobian matrix has rank two is called ''regular'', or, more properly, the parametrization is called ''regular'' at {{mvar|p}}.

The '''tangent plane''' at a regular point {{mvar|p}} is the unique plane passing through {{mvar|p}} and having a direction parallel to the two [[row vector]]s of the Jacobian matrix. The tangent plane is an [[affine property|affine concept]], because its definition is independent of the choice of a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]]. In other words, any [[affine transformation]] maps the tangent plane to the surface at a point to the tangent plane to the image of the surface at the image of the point.

The '''[[normal vector|normal line]]''', or simply '''normal''' at a point of a surface is the unique line passing through the point and perpendicular to the tangent plane. A [[normal vector]] is a vector which is parallel to the normal.

For other [[differential invariant]]s of surfaces, in the neighborhood of a point, see [[Differential geometry of surfaces]].

===Irregular point and singular point===
A point of a parametric surface which is not regular is '''irregular'''. There are several kinds of irregular points.

It may occur that an irregular point becomes regular, if one changes the parametrization. This is the case of the poles in the parametrization of the [[unit sphere]] by [[Euler angles]]: it suffices to permute the role of the different [[coordinate axes]] for changing the poles.

On the other hand, consider the [[circular cone]] of parametric equation
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
x&amp;= t\cos(u)\\
y&amp;=t\sin(u)\\
z&amp;=t\,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
The apex of the cone is the origin {{math|(0, 0, 0)}}, and is obtained for {{math|1=''t'' = 0}}. It is an irregular point that remains irregular, whichever parametrization is chosen (otherwise, there would exist a unique tangent plane). Such an irregular point, where the tangent plane is undefined, is said '''singular'''.

There is another kind of singular points. There are the '''self-crossing points''', that is the points where the surface crosses itself. In other words, these are the points which are obtained for (at least) two different values of the parameters.

===Graph of a bivariate function===

Let {{math|1=''z'' = ''f''(''x'', ''y'')}} be a function of two real variables. This is a parametric surface, parametrized as 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
x&amp;= t\\
y&amp;=u\\
z&amp;=f(t,u)\,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Every point of this surface is regular, as the two first columns of the Jacobian matrix form the [[identity matrix]] of rank two.

===Rational surface===
{{main|Rational surface}}
A '''rational surface''' is a surface that may be parametrized by [[rational functions]] of two variables. That is, if {{math|''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'', ''u'')}} are, for {{math|1=''i'' = 0, 1, 2, 3}}, [[polynomial]]s in two indeterminates, then the parametric surface, defined by 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
x&amp;= \frac{f_1(t,u)}{f_0(t,u)}\\
y&amp;=\frac{f_2(t,u)}{f_0(t,u)}\\
z&amp;=\frac{f_3(t,u)}{f_0(t,u)}\,, 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
is a rational surface.

A rational surface is an [[algebraic surface]], but most algebraic surfaces are not rational.

==Implicit surface==
{{main|Implicit surface}}
An implicit surface in a [[Euclidean space]] (or, more generally, in an [[affine space]]) of dimension 3 is the set of the common zeros of a [[differentiable function]] of three variables
:&lt;math&gt;f(x, y, z)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Implicit means that the equation defines implicitly one of the variables as a function of the other variables. This is made more exact by the [[implicit function theorem]]: if {{math|1=''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0}}, and the partial derivative in {{mvar|z}} of {{mvar|f}} is not zero at {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, then there exists a differentiable function {{math|''φ''(''x'', ''y'')}} such that
:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y,\varphi(x,y))=0&lt;/math&gt;
in a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. In other words, the implicit surface is the [[graph of a function]] near a point of the surface where the partial derivative in {{mvar|z}} is nonzero. An implicit surface has thus, locally, a parametric representation, except at the points of the surface where the three partial derivatives are zero.

===Regular points and tangent plane===
A point of the surface where at least one partial derivative of {{mvar|f}} is nonzero is called '''regular'''. At such a point &lt;math&gt;(x_0, y_0, z_0)&lt;/math&gt;, the tangent plane and the direction of the normal are well defined, and may be deduced, with the implicit function theorem from the definition given above, in {{slink||Tangent plane and normal vector}}. The direction of the normal is the [[gradient]], that is the vector
:&lt;math&gt;\left[\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x_0, y_0, z_0), \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x_0, y_0, z_0), \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}(x_0, y_0, z_0)\right].&lt;/math&gt;
The tangent plane is defined by its implicit equation
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x_0, y_0, z_0)(x-x_0) + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x_0, y_0, z_0) (y-y_0)+ \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}(x_0, y_0, z_0)(z-z_0) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Singular point===
A '''singular point''' of an implicit surface (in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^3&lt;/math&gt;) is a point of the surface where the implicit equation holds and the three partial derivatives of its defining function are all zero. Therefore, the singular points are the solutions of a [[simultaneous equations|system]] of four equations in three indeterminates. As most such systems have no solution, many surfaces do not have any singular point. A surface with no singular point is called ''regular'' or ''non-singular''.

The study of surfaces near their singular points and the classification of the singular points is [[singularity theory]]. A singular point is [[isolated singularity|isolated]] if there is no other singular point in a neighborhood of it. Otherwise, the singular points may form a curve. This is in particular the case for self-crossing surfaces.

==Algebraic surface==
{{main|Algebraic surface}}
Originally, an algebraic surface was a surface which may be defined by an implicit equation
:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y,z)=0,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''f''}} is a polynomial in three [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]]s, with real coefficients.

The concept has been extended in several directions, by defining surfaces over arbitrary [[field (mathematics)|field]]s, and by considering surfaces in spaces of arbitrary dimension or in [[projective space]]s. Abstract algebraic surfaces, which are not explicitly embedded in another space, are also considered.

===Surfaces over arbitrary fields===
Polynomials with coefficients in any [[field (mathematics)|field]] are accepted for defining an algebraic surface. 
However, the field of coefficients of a polynomial is not well defined, as, for example, a polynomial with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients may also be considered as a polynomial with [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] coefficients. Therefore, the concept of ''point'' of the surface has been generalized in the following way:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Weil | first1=André | author1-link=André Weil | title=Foundations of Algebraic Geometry | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ML7u26rkEkIC | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | location=Providence, R.I. | series=American Mathematical Society Colloquium Publications |volume=29  |mr=0023093 | year=1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given a polynomial {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}}, let {{math|''k''}} be the smallest field containing the coefficients, and {{math|''K''}} be an [[algebraically closed extension]] of  {{math|''k''}}, of infinite [[transcendence degree]].&lt;ref&gt;The infinite degree of transcendence is a technical condition, which allows an accurate definition of the concept of [[generic point]].&lt;/ref&gt; Then a ''point'' of the surface is an element of {{math|''K''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} which is a solution of the equation
:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y,z)=0.&lt;/math&gt;
If the polynomial has real coefficients, the field {{math|''K''}} is the [[complex field]], and a point of the surface that belongs to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; (a usual point) is called a ''real point''. A point that belongs to {{math|''k''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} is called ''rational over {{math|k}}'', or simply a ''rational point'', if {{math|''k''}} is the field of [[rational number]]s.

===Projective surface===
A '''projective surface''' in a [[projective space]] of dimension three is the set of points whose [[homogeneous coordinates]] are zeros of a single [[homogeneous polynomial]] in four variables. More generally, a projective surface is a subset of a projective space, which is a [[projective variety]] of [[dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]] two.

Projective surfaces are strongly related to affine surfaces (that is, ordinary algebraic surfaces). One passes from a projective surface to the corresponding affine surface by setting to one some coordinate or indeterminate of the defining polynomials (usually the last one). Conversely, one passes from an affine surface to its associated projective surface (called ''projective completion'') by [[Homogeneous polynomial#Homogenization|homogenizing]] the defining polynomial (in case of surfaces in a space of dimension three), or by homogenizing all polynomials of the defining ideal (for surfaces in a space of higher dimension).

===In higher dimensional spaces===
One cannot define the concept of an algebraic surface in a space of dimension higher than three without a general definition of an [[algebraic variety]] and of the [[dimension of an algebraic variety]]. In fact, an algebraic surface is an ''algebraic variety of dimension two''.

More precisely, an algebraic surface in a space of dimension {{mvar|n}} is the set of the common zeros of at least {{math|''n'' – 2}} polynomials, but these polynomials must satisfy further conditions that may be not immediate to verify. Firstly, the polynomials must not define a variety or an [[algebraic set]] of higher dimension, which is typically the case if one of the polynomials is in the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by the others. Generally, {{math|''n'' – 2}} polynomials define an algebraic set of dimension two or higher. If the dimension is two, the algebraic set may have several [[irreducible component]]s. If there is only one component the {{math|''n'' – 2}} polynomials define a surface, which is a [[complete intersection]]. If there are several components, then one needs further polynomials for selecting a specific component.

Most authors consider as an algebraic surface only algebraic varieties of dimension two, but some also consider as surfaces all algebraic sets whose irreducible components have the dimension two.

In the case of surfaces in a space of dimension three, every surface is a complete intersection, and a surface is defined by a single polynomial, which is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] or not, depending on whether non-irreducible algebraic sets of dimension two are considered as surfaces or not.

==Topological surface==
{{main|Surface (topology)}}
In [[topology]], a surface is generally defined as a [[manifold]] of dimension two. This means that a topological surface is a [[topological space]] such that every point has a [[neighborhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] that is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to an [[open subset]] of a [[Euclidean plane]].

Every topological surface is homeomorphic to a [[polyhedral surface]] such that all [[facet (geometry)|facets]] are [[triangle]]s. The [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] study of such arrangements of triangles (or, more generally, of higher-dimensional [[simplex]]es) is the starting object of [[algebraic topology]]. This allows the characterization of the properties of surfaces in terms of purely algebraic [[invariant (mathematics)|invariants]], such as the [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] and [[homology group]]s.

The homeomorphism classes of surfaces have been completely described (see [[Surface (topology)]]).

In physics, '''geometrothermodynamics (GTD)''' is a formalism developed in 2007 by Hernando Quevedo to describe the properties of [[thermodynamic]] systems in terms of concepts of differential geometry.&lt;ref name=quev07&gt;{{cite journal|last=Quevedo | first=Hernando|year=2007|title=Geometrothermodynamics|journal=J. Math. Phys.|volume=48|pages=013506|arxiv=physics/0604164 |bibcode=2007JMP....48a3506Q|doi=10.1063/1.2409524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider a  thermodynamic system in the framework of classical equilibrium thermodynamics. The states of thermodynamic equilibrium are considered as points of an abstract equilibrium space in which a Riemannian metric can be introduced in several ways. In particular, one can introduce [[Hessian matrix|Hessian]] metrics like the [[Fisher information metric]], the [[Weinhold metric]], the [[Ruppeiner metric]] and others, whose components are calculated as the Hessian of a particular [[thermodynamic potential]]. 

Another possibility is to introduce metrics which are independent of the thermodynamic potential, a property which is shared by all thermodynamic systems in classical thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Callen|first=Herbert B.| title=Thermodynamics and an Introduction to Thermostatistics
|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc.|year=1985 | isbn=0-471-86256-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since a change of thermodynamic potential is equivalent to a [[Legendre transformation]], and Legendre transformations do not act in the equilibrium space, it is necessary to introduce an auxiliary space to correctly handle the Legendre transformations. This is the so-called thermodynamic phase space. If the phase space is equipped with a Legendre invariant Riemannian metric, a smooth map can be introduced that induces a thermodynamic metric in the equilibrium manifold. The thermodynamic metric can then be used with different thermodynamic potentials without changing the geometric properties of the equilibrium manifold.  One expects the geometric properties of the equilibrium manifold to be related to the macroscopic physical properties. 

The details of this relation can be summarized in three main points:
#Curvature is a measure of the thermodynamical interaction.
#Curvature singularities correspond to curvature phase transitions. 
#Thermodynamic geodesics correspond to quasi-static processes.

==Geometric aspects==
{{complex|section|date=June 2018}}

The main ingredient of GTD is a (2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional manifold &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; 
with coordinates &lt;math&gt;Z^A=\{\Phi,E^a,I^a\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary thermodynamic potential, &lt;math&gt;E^a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a=1,2,\ldots,n&lt;/math&gt;, are the
extensive variables, and &lt;math&gt;I^a&lt;/math&gt; the intensive variables. It is also
possible to introduce in a canonical manner the fundamental
one-form &lt;math&gt;\Theta = d\Phi - \delta_{ab}I^a d E^b&lt;/math&gt; (summation over repeated indices) with &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ab}={\rm
diag}(+1,\ldots,+1)&lt;/math&gt;, which satisfies the condition &lt;math&gt;\Theta \wedge
(d\Theta)^n \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of thermodynamic
degrees of freedom of the system, and is invariant with respect to
Legendre transformations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Arnold|first=V.I.|title=Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics|publisher=[[Springer Verlag]]|year=1989|isbn=0-387-96890-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/mathematicalmeth0000arno}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\{Z^A\}\longrightarrow \{\widetilde{Z}^A\}=\{\tilde \Phi, \tilde E ^a, \tilde I ^ a\}\ ,\quad
\Phi = \tilde \Phi - \delta_{kl} \tilde E ^k \tilde I ^l ,\quad
E^i = - \tilde I ^{i}, \quad 
  E^j = \tilde E ^j,\quad   
 I^{i} = \tilde E ^i , \quad 
 I^j = \tilde I ^j \ ,
 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;i\cup j&lt;/math&gt; is any disjoint decomposition of the set of indices &lt;math&gt;\{1,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt;,
and &lt;math&gt;k,l= 1,\ldots,i&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, for &lt;math&gt;i=\{1,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; we obtain
the total Legendre transformation and the identity, respectively.
It is also assumed that in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{T} &lt;/math&gt; 
there exists a metric &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt; which is also
invariant with respect to Legendre transformations. The triad
&lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{T},\Theta,G)&lt;/math&gt; defines a Riemannian [[contact manifold]] which is
called the thermodynamic phase space (phase manifold). The space of
thermodynamic equilibrium states (equilibrium manifold)  is an
n-dimensional [[Riemannian submanifold]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}\subset \mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt;
induced by a smooth map &lt;math&gt;\varphi:\mathcal{E}\rightarrow\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt;,
i.e. &lt;math&gt;\varphi:\{E^a\} \mapsto \{\Phi,E^a,I^a\}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\Phi=\Phi(E^a)&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;I^a= I^a(E^a)&lt;/math&gt;,  such that &lt;math&gt; \varphi^*(\Theta)=\varphi^*(d\Phi
- \delta_{ab}I^{a}dE^{b})=0 &lt;/math&gt; holds, where &lt;math&gt;\varphi^*&lt;/math&gt; is the
pullback of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;. The manifold &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; is naturally equipped
with the Riemannian metric &lt;math&gt;g=\varphi^*(G)&lt;/math&gt;. The purpose of GTD is
to demonstrate that the geometric properties of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; are
related to the thermodynamic properties of a system with fundamental
thermodynamic equation &lt;math&gt;\Phi=\Phi(E^a)&lt;/math&gt;.
The condition of invariance with respect total Legendre transformations leads to the metrics

: &lt;math&gt;
G^I = (d\Phi- \delta_{ab}I^a d E^b)^2 + \Lambda\, (\xi_{ab} E^a I^b)\left( \delta_{cd} dE^c d I^d\right)\ ,\quad
\delta_{ab}={\rm diag}(1,\ldots,1)
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
G^{II} = (d\Phi- \delta_{ab}I^a d E^b)^2 + \Lambda\, (\xi_{ab} E^a I^b)\left( \eta_{cd} dE^c d I^d\right)\ ,\quad
\eta_{ab}={\rm diag}(-1,1,\ldots,1)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\xi_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; is a constant diagonal matrix that can be expressed in terms of &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;\eta_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary Legendre invariant function of &lt;math&gt;Z^A&lt;/math&gt;. The metrics &lt;math&gt;G^I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G^{II}&lt;/math&gt; have been used to describe thermodynamic systems with first and second order phase transitions, respectively. The most general metric which is invariant with respect to partial Legendre transformations is

: &lt;math&gt;
G^{III} = (d\Phi- \delta_{ab}I^a d E^b)^2 + \Lambda\, ( E_a I_a)^{2k+1} \left( dE^a d I^a\right)\ ,
\quad
 E_a= \delta_{ab} E^b \ , 
\quad I_a = \delta_{ab} I^b \ .
&lt;/math&gt;

The components of the corresponding metric for the equilibrium manifold &lt;math&gt; {\mathcal E} &lt;/math&gt; can be computed as

: &lt;math&gt;
g_{ab} = \frac{\partial Z^A}{\partial E^a}\frac{\partial Z^B}{\partial E^b} G_{AB}\ .
&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
GTD has been applied to describe laboratory systems like the ideal gas, van der Waals gas, the Ising model, etc., more exotic systems like black holes in different gravity theories,&lt;ref name=qstv11&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quevedo | first1=H.|last2=Sanchez | first2=A. |last3=Taj | first3=S.|last4=Vazquez | first4=A. |year=2011|title=Phase transitions in Geometrothermodynamics|journal=Gen.

'''Local coordinates''' are the ones used in a ''local [[coordinate system]]'' or a ''local [[coordinate space]]''. Simple examples:

* Houses. In order to work in a house construction, the measurements are referred to a control arbitrary point that will allow to check it: stick/sticks on the ground, steel bar, nails...
* Addresses. Using house numbers to locate a [[house]] on a [[street]]; the street is a local coordinate system within a larger system composed of city townships, states, countries, postal codes, etc.

Local systems exist for convenience. On ancient times, every work was made on relative bases as there was no conception of global systems. Practically, it is better to use local systems for small works as houses, buildings... For most of the applications, it is desired the position of one element relative to one building or location, and in a more local way, relative to one furniture or person. In a regular way, you will not give your position by geographical coordinates rather than "I am 15 meters away of the entry to the building". So it is a pretty common way to locate things.

It is possible to bring [[latitude and longitude]] for all terrestrial locations, but unless one has a highly precise [[GPS]] device or you make astronomical observations, this is impractical. It is much simple to use a tape, a rope, a chain... The position information (global) should be transformed into a location. Position refers to a  numeric or symbolic description within a spatial reference system, where as location refers to information about surrounding objects and their interrelationships&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZgpEDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT200&amp;dq=local+coordinates#v=onepage|title=Local Positioning Systems: LBS Applications and Services|last=Kolodziej|first=Krzysztof W.|last2=Hjelm|first2=Johan|date=2017-12-19|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781351837972|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. ([[Topological space]])

== Use ==
In [[computer graphics]] and [[computer animation]], local coordinate spaces are also useful for their ability to model independently transformable aspects of geometrical [[scene graph]]s. When modeling a car, for example, it is desirable to describe the center of each wheel with respect to the car's coordinate system, but then specify the shape of each wheel in separate local spaces centered about these points. This way, the information describing each wheel can be simply duplicated four times, and independent transformations (e.g., steering rotation) can be similarly effected. Bounding volumes of objects may be described more accurately using extents in the local coordinates, (i.e. an [[object oriented bounding box]], contrasted with the simpler [[axis aligned bounding box]]). The trade-off for this flexibility is additional computational cost: the rendering system must access the higher-level coordinate system of the car and combine it with the space of each wheel in order to draw everything in its proper place.

Local coordinates also afford digital designers a means around the finite limits of numerical representation. The [[tread marks]] on a tire, for example, can be described using millimeters by allowing the whole tire to occupy the entire range of numeric precision available. The larger aspects of the car, such as its frame, might be described in centimeters, and the terrain that the car travels on could be specified in meters.

In [[differential topology]], local coordinates on a [[manifold]] are defined by means of an [[atlas (topology)|atlas of charts]]. The basic idea behind coordinate charts is that each small patch of a manifold can be endowed with a set of local coordinates. These are collected together into an atlas, and stitched together in such a way that they are self-consistent on the manifold.

In [[Cartography]] and [[Map|Maps]], the traditional way of works are [[Datum reference|local datum]]. With a local datum&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U2JmghrrB8cC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=local+coordinates#v=onepage|title=Introduction to GPS: The Global Positioning System|last=El-Rabbany|first=Ahmed|date=2002|publisher=Artech House|isbn=9781580531832|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the land can be mapped on relative small areas as a country. With the need of global systems, the transformations on between datum became a problem, so geodetic datum have been created. More than 150 local datum have been used in the world.

      <text bytes="4494" xml:space="preserve">The '''Minkowski [[content (measure theory)|content]]''' (named after [[Hermann Minkowski]]), or the '''boundary measure''', of a set is a basic concept that uses concepts from [[geometry]] and [[measure theory]] to generalize the notions of [[arc length|length]] of a [[smooth curve]] in the plane, and [[surface area|area]] of a smooth surface in [[euclidean space|space]], to arbitrary [[measurable set]]s. 

It is typically applied to [[fractal]] boundaries of domains in the [[Euclidean space]], but it can also be used in the context of general metric [[Measure space|measure spaces.]]

It is related to, although different from, the [[Hausdorff measure]].
&lt;!--== Definition ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle(X,\, \mu,\, d)&lt;/math&gt; be a metric measure space, where ''d'' is a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] on ''X'' and &amp;mu; is a [[Borel measure]]. For a subset ''A'' of ''X'' and real &amp;epsilon; &gt; 0, let

: &lt;math&gt;A_\varepsilon = \{ x \in X \, | \, d(x, A) \leq \varepsilon \}&lt;/math&gt;

be the &amp;epsilon;-''extension'' of ''A''. The '''lower Minkowski content''' of ''A'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;M_*(A) = \liminf_{\varepsilon \to 0} \frac{\mu(A_\varepsilon) - \mu(A)}{\varepsilon},&lt;/math&gt;

and the '''upper Minkowski content''' of ''A'' is

:&lt;math&gt;M^*(A) = \limsup_{\varepsilon \to 0} \frac{\mu(A_\varepsilon) - \mu(A)}{\varepsilon}.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''M''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(''A''), then the common value is called the '''Minkowski content''' of ''A'' associated with the measure &amp;mu;, and is denoted by ''M''(''A'').--&gt;
&lt;!-- old section header being replaced with Definition, as original section commented above is not in either source.... == Minkowski content in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ==--&gt;
==Definition==
For &lt;math&gt; A \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;, and each integer ''m'' with &lt;math&gt; 0 \leq m \leq n&lt;/math&gt;, the '''''m''-dimensional upper Minkowski content''' is

:&lt;math&gt;M^{*m}(A) = \limsup_{r \to 0^+} \frac{\mu(\{x: d(x,A) &lt; r\})}{\alpha (n-m)r^{n-m}}&lt;/math&gt;

and the '''''m''-dimensional lower Minkowski content''' is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;M_*^m(A) = \liminf_{r \to 0^+} \frac{\mu(\{x: d(x,A) &lt; r\})}{\alpha (n-m)r^{n-m}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha(n-m)r^{n-m}&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the [[N-sphere|(''n''&amp;minus;''m'')-ball]] of radius r and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[Lebesgue measure]]. 

If the upper and lower ''m''-dimensional Minkowski content of ''A'' are equal, then their common value is called the Minkowski content ''M''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;(''A'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Federer|1969|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=jld-BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA273 p. 273]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krantz|1999|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=sADLB3ybGS0C&amp;pg=PA74 p. 74]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
* The Minkowski content is (generally) not a measure.  In particular, the ''m''-dimensional Minkowski content in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; is not a measure unless ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, in which case it is the [[counting measure]].  Indeed, clearly the Minkowski content assigns the same value to the set ''A'' as well as its [[closure (topology)|closure]].
* If ''A'' is a closed ''m''-[[rectifiable set]] in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, given as the image of a bounded set from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; under a [[Lipschitz function]], then the ''m''-dimensional Minkowski content of ''A'' exists, and is equal to the ''m''-dimensional [[Hausdorff measure]] of ''A''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Federer |first1=Herbert |title=Geometric Measure Theory|date=1969|publisher=Springer|page=paragraph 3.2.29}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Miller indices''' form a notation system in [[crystallography]] for planes in [[Bravais lattice|crystal (Bravais) lattices]].

In particular, a family of [[lattice plane]]s is determined by three [[integer]]s ''h'', ''k'', and&amp;nbsp;''ℓ'', the ''Miller indices''.  They are written (hkℓ), and denote the family of planes orthogonal to &lt;math&gt;h\mathbf{b_1} + k\mathbf{b_2} + \ell\mathbf{b_3}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b_i}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of the [[reciprocal lattice]] vectors (note that the plane is not always orthogonal to the linear combination of direct lattice vectors &lt;math&gt;h\mathbf{a_1} + k\mathbf{a_2} + \ell\mathbf{a_3}&lt;/math&gt; because the  lattice vectors need not be mutually orthogonal). By convention, [[negative integer]]s are written with a bar, as in {{overline|3}} for&amp;nbsp;−3.  The integers are usually written in lowest terms, i.e. their [[greatest common divisor]] should be&amp;nbsp;1. Miller indices are also used to designate reflections in [[X-ray crystallography]]. In this case the integers are not necessarily in lowest terms, and can be thought of as corresponding to planes spaced such that the reflections from adjacent planes would have a phase difference of exactly one wavelength (2π), regardless of whether there are atoms on all these planes or not.

There are also several related notations:&lt;ref name="Ash"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/solidstatephysic00ashc|title=Solid state physics|last1=Ashcroft|first1=Neil W.|date=1976|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|last2=Mermin|first2=N. David|isbn=0030839939|location=New York|oclc=934604|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the notation {hkℓ} denotes the set of all planes that are equivalent to (hkℓ) by the symmetry of the lattice.
In the context of crystal ''directions'' (not planes), the corresponding notations are:
*[hkℓ], with square instead of round brackets, denotes a direction in the basis of the ''direct'' lattice vectors instead of the reciprocal lattice; and
*similarly, the notation &lt;hkℓ&gt; denotes the set of all directions that are equivalent to [hkℓ] by symmetry.

Miller indices were introduced in 1839 by the British mineralogist [[William Hallowes Miller]], although an almost identical system (''Weiss parameters'') had already been used by German mineralogist [[Christian Samuel Weiss]] since 1817.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weiss |first1=Christian Samuel |title=Ueber eine verbesserte Methode für die Bezeichnung der verschiedenen Flächen eines Krystallisationssystems, nebst Bemerkungen über den Zustand der Polarisierung der Seiten in den Linien der krystallinischen Structur |journal=Abhandlungen der physikalischen Klasse der Königlich-Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften |date=1817 |pages=286–336 |url=https://archive.org/stream/abhandlungenderp16akad#page/286/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method was also historically known as the Millerian system, and the indices as Millerian,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com Oxford English Dictionary Online] (Consulted May 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; although this is now rare.

The Miller indices are defined with respect to any choice of unit cell and not only with respect to primitive basis vectors, as is sometimes stated.

==Definition==
[[Image:Indices miller plan definition.svg|thumb|300px|Examples of determining indices for a plane using intercepts with axes; left (111), right (221)]]
There are two equivalent ways to define the meaning of the Miller indices:&lt;ref name="Ash"/&gt; via a point in the [[reciprocal lattice]], or as the inverse intercepts along the lattice vectors.  Both definitions are given below.  In either case, one needs to choose the three lattice vectors '''a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', and '''a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''' that define the unit cell (note that the conventional unit cell may be larger than the primitive cell of the [[Bravais lattice]], as the [[Miller_index#Case_of_cubic_structures|examples below]] illustrate). Given these, the three primitive reciprocal lattice vectors are also determined (denoted '''b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', and '''b&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''').

Then, given the three Miller indices h, k, ℓ, (hkℓ) denotes planes orthogonal to the reciprocal lattice vector:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{g}_{hk\ell} = h \mathbf{b}_1 + k \mathbf{b}_2 + \ell \mathbf{b}_3 .&lt;/math&gt;
That is, (hkℓ) simply indicates a normal to the planes in the [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of the primitive reciprocal lattice vectors.  Because the coordinates  are integers, this normal is itself always a reciprocal lattice vector.  The requirement of lowest terms means that it is the ''shortest'' reciprocal lattice vector in the given direction.

Equivalently, (hkℓ) denotes a plane that intercepts the three points '''a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''/''h'', '''a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''/''k'', and '''a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''/''ℓ'', or some multiple thereof.  That is, the Miller indices are proportional to the ''inverses'' of the intercepts of the plane, in the basis of the lattice vectors.  If one of the indices is zero, it means that the planes do not intersect that axis (the intercept is "at infinity").

Considering only (hkℓ) planes intersecting one or more lattice points (the ''lattice planes''), the perpendicular distance ''d'' between adjacent lattice planes is related to the (shortest) reciprocal lattice vector orthogonal to the planes by the formula: &lt;math&gt;d = 2\pi / |\mathbf{g}_{h k \ell}|&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Ash"/&gt;

The related notation [hkℓ] denotes the ''direction'':
:&lt;math&gt;h \mathbf{a}_1 + k \mathbf{a}_2 + \ell \mathbf{a}_3 .&lt;/math&gt;
That is, it uses the direct lattice basis instead of the reciprocal lattice.  Note that [hkℓ] is ''not'' generally normal to the (hkℓ) planes, except in a cubic lattice as described below.

==Case of cubic structures==
For the special case of simple cubic crystals, the lattice vectors are orthogonal and of equal length (usually denoted ''a''), as are those of the reciprocal lattice.  Thus, in this common case, the Miller indices (hkℓ) and [hkℓ] both simply denote normals/directions in [[Cartesian coordinates]].

For cubic crystals with [[lattice constant]] ''a'', the spacing ''d'' between adjacent (hkℓ) lattice planes is (from above)
: &lt;math&gt;d_{hk \ell}= \frac {a} { \sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + \ell ^2} }&lt;/math&gt;.

Because of the symmetry of cubic crystals, it is possible to change the place and sign of the integers and have equivalent directions and planes:
*Indices in ''angle brackets'' such as ⟨100⟩ denote a ''family'' of directions which are equivalent due to symmetry operations, such as [100], [010], [001] or the negative of any of those directions.
*Indices in ''curly brackets'' or ''braces'' such as {100} denote a family of plane normals which are equivalent due to symmetry operations, much the way angle brackets denote a family of directions.

For [[face-centered cubic]] and [[body-centered cubic]] lattices, the primitive lattice vectors are not orthogonal.  However, in these cases the Miller indices are conventionally defined relative to the lattice vectors of the cubic [[supercell (crystal)|supercell]] and hence are again simply the Cartesian directions.

==Case of hexagonal and rhombohedral structures==

[[Image:Miller-bravais.svg|thumb|Miller-Bravais indices]]

With [[hexagonal lattice system|hexagonal]] and [[rhombohedral lattice system|rhombohedral]] [[lattice system]]s, it is possible to use the '''Bravais-Miller''' system, which uses four indices (''h'' ''k'' ''i'' ''ℓ'') that obey the constraint
: ''h'' + ''k'' + ''i'' = 0.
Here ''h'', ''k'' and ''ℓ'' are identical to the corresponding Miller indices, and ''i'' is a redundant index.

This four-index scheme for labeling planes in a hexagonal lattice makes permutation symmetries apparent.  For example, the similarity between (110) ≡ (11{{overline|2}}0) and (1{{overline|2}}0) ≡ (1{{overline|2}}10) is more obvious when the redundant index is shown.

In the figure at right, the (001) plane has a 3-fold symmetry: it remains unchanged by a rotation of 1/3 (2π/3 rad, 120°). The [100], [010] and the [{{overline|1}}{{overline|1}}0] directions are really similar. If ''S'' is the intercept of the plane with the [{{overline|1}}{{overline|1}}0] axis, then
: ''i'' = 1/''S''.

There are also ''[[ad hoc]]'' schemes (e.g. in the [[transmission electron microscopy]] literature) for indexing hexagonal ''lattice vectors'' (rather than reciprocal lattice vectors or planes) with four indices.  However they don't operate by similarly adding a redundant index to the regular three-index set.

For example, the reciprocal lattice vector (hkℓ) as suggested above can be written in terms of reciprocal lattice vectors as &lt;math&gt;h\mathbf{b_1} + k\mathbf{b_2} + \ell\mathbf{b_3}&lt;/math&gt;. For hexagonal crystals this may be expressed in terms of direct-lattice basis-vectors '''a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''' as

:&lt;math&gt;h\mathbf{b_1} + k\mathbf{b_2} + \ell \mathbf{b_3}= \frac{2}{3 a^2}(2 h + k)\mathbf{a_1} + \frac{2}{3 a^2}(h+2k)\mathbf{a_2} + \frac{1}{c^2} (\ell) \mathbf{a_3}.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence zone indices of the direction perpendicular to plane (hkℓ) are, in suitably normalized triplet form, simply &lt;math&gt;[2h+k,h+2k,\ell(3/2)(a/c)^2]&lt;/math&gt;.  When ''four indices'' are used for the zone normal to plane (hkℓ), however, the literature often uses &lt;math&gt;[h,k,-h-k,\ell(3/2)(a/c)^2]&lt;/math&gt; instead.&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Edington (1976) ''Practical electron microscopy in materials science'' (N. V. Philips' Gloeilampenfabrieken, Eindhoven) {{ISBN|1-878907-35-2}}, Appendix 2&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus as you can see, four-index zone indices in square or angle brackets sometimes mix a single direct-lattice index on the right with reciprocal-lattice indices (normally in round or curly brackets) on the left.

And, note that for hexagonal interplanar distances, they take the form
:&lt;math&gt;
d_{hk\ell} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{\tfrac{4}{3}\left(h^2+k^2+hk \right)+\tfrac{a^2}{c^2}\ell^2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Crystallographic planes and directions==
{{More citations needed section|date=July 2019}}
[[Image:Cristal densite surface.svg|thumb|Dense crystallographic planes]]

Crystallographic directions are [[line (mathematics)|lines]] linking nodes ([[atom]]s, [[ion]]s or [[molecule]]s) of a crystal. Similarly, crystallographic [[plane (mathematics)|planes]] are ''planes'' linking nodes. Some directions and planes have a higher density of nodes; these dense planes have an influence on the behavior of the crystal:
*[[optics|optical properties]]: in condensed matter, [[light]] "jumps" from one atom to the other with the [[Rayleigh scattering]]; the [[velocity of light]] thus varies according to the directions, whether the atoms are close or far; this gives the [[birefringence]]
*[[adsorption]] and [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]]: adsorption and chemical reactions can occur at atoms or molecules on crystal surfaces, these phenomena are thus sensitive to the density of nodes;
*[[surface tension]]: the condensation of a material means that the atoms, ions or molecules are more stable if they are surrounded by other similar species; the surface tension of an interface thus varies according to the density on the surface
** Pores and [[crystallite]]s tend to have straight grain boundaries following dense planes
**[[cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]]
*[[dislocation]]s ([[plastic deformation]])
**the dislocation core tends to spread on dense planes (the elastic perturbation is "diluted"); this reduces the [[friction]] ([[Peierls–Nabarro force]]), the sliding occurs more frequently on dense planes;
**the perturbation carried by the dislocation ([[Burgers vector]]) is along a dense direction: the shift of one node in a dense direction is a lesser distortion;
**the dislocation line tends to follow a dense direction, the dislocation line is often a straight line, a dislocation loop is often a [[polygon]].
For all these reasons, it is important to determine the planes and thus to have a notation system.

==Integer vs. irrational Miller indices: Lattice planes and quasicrystals==

Ordinarily, Miller indices are always integers by definition, and this constraint is physically significant.  To understand this, suppose that we allow a plane (abc) where the Miller "indices" ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' (defined as above) are not necessarily integers.

If ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' have [[rational number|rational]] ratios, then the same family of planes can be written in terms of integer indices (hkℓ) by scaling ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' appropriately: divide by the largest of the three numbers, and then multiply by the [[least common denominator]].  Thus, integer Miller indices implicitly include indices with all rational ratios.  The reason why planes where the components (in the reciprocal-lattice basis) have rational ratios are of special interest is that these are the [[lattice plane]]s: they are the only planes whose intersections with the crystal are 2d-periodic.

For a plane (abc) where ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' have [[irrational number|irrational]] ratios, on the other hand, the intersection of the plane with the crystal is ''not'' periodic.  It forms an aperiodic pattern known as a [[quasicrystal]]. This construction corresponds precisely to the standard "cut-and-project" method of defining a quasicrystal, using a plane with irrational-ratio Miller indices. (Although many quasicrystals, such as the [[Penrose tiling]], are formed by "cuts" of periodic lattices in more than three dimensions, involving the intersection of more than one such [[hyperplane]].)

[[File:Teorema de desargues.svg|thumb|right|An illustration of [[Desargues' theorem]], a result in [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]] and [[projective geometry]]]]

'''Geometry''' (from the {{lang-grc|γεωμετρία}}; ''[[wikt:γῆ|geo-]]'' "earth", ''[[wikt:μέτρον|-metron]]'' "measurement") is, with [[arithmetic]], one of the oldest branches of [[mathematics]]. It is concerned with properties of space that are related with distance, shape, size, and relative position of figures.&lt;!--Please, do not link this everyday word--&gt;&lt;ref name="Risi2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vincenzo De Risi|title=Mathematizing Space: The Objects of Geometry from Antiquity to the Early Modern Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1m11BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1|date=31 January 2015|publisher=Birkhäuser|isbn=978-3-319-12102-4|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mathematician who works in the field of geometry is called a [[List of geometers|geometer]].

Until the 19th century, geometry was almost exclusively devoted to [[Euclidean geometry]],{{efn|Until the 19th century, geometry was dominated by the assumption that all geometric constructions were Euclidean. In the 19th century and later, this was challenged by the development of [[hyperbolic geometry]] by [[Lobachevsky]] and other [[non-Euclidean geometries]] by [[Gauss]] and others. It was then realised that implicitly non-Euclidean geometry had appeared throughout history, including the work of [[Desargues]] in the 17th Century, all the way back to the implicit use of [[spherical geometry]] to understand the [[geodesy|Earth geodesy]] and to navigate the oceans since antiquity.}} which includes the notions of [[point (geometry)|point]], [[line (geometry)|line]], [[plane (geometry)|plane]], [[distance]], [[angle]], [[surface (mathematics)|surface]], and [[curve]], as fundamental concepts.&lt;ref name="Tabak 2014 xiv"&gt;{{cite book |last= Tabak|first= John|date= 2014|title= Geometry: the language of space and form|url= |location= |publisher= Infobase Publishing|page=xiv |isbn=978-0816049530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century several discoveries enlarged dramatically the scope of geometry. One of the oldest such discoveries is [[Gauss]]' [[Theorema Egregium]] (remarkable theorem) that asserts roughly that the [[Gaussian curvature]] of a surface is independent from any specific [[embedding]] in an [[Euclidean space]]. This implies that surfaces can be studied ''intrinsically'', that is as stand alone spaces, and has been expanded into the theory of [[manifold]]s and [[Riemannian geometry]].

Later in the 19th century, it appeared that geometries without the [[parallel postulate]] ([[non-Euclidean geometries]]) can be developed without introducing any contradiction. The geometry that underlies [[general relativity]] is a famous application of non-Euclidean geometry. 

Since then, the scope of geometry has been greatly expanded, and the field has been split in many subfields that depend on the underlying methods—[[differential geometry]], [[algebraic geometry]], [[computational geometry]], [[algebraic topology]], [[discrete geometry]] (also known as ''combinatorial geometry''), etc.—or on the properties of Euclidean spaces that are disregarded—[[projective geometry]] that consider only alignment of points but not distance and parallelism, [[affine geometry]] that omits the concept of angle and distance, [[finite geometry]] that that omits [[continuity (mathematics)|continuity]], etc.

Often developed with the aim to model the physical world, geometry has applications to almost all [[science]]s, and also to [[art]], [[architecture]], and other activities that are related to [[graphics]].&lt;ref name="Meyer2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter A. Meyer|title=Geometry and Its Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ez6H5Ho6E3cC|date=21 February 2006|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-047803-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geometry has also applications to areas of mathematics that are apparently unrelated. For example, methods of algebraic geometry are fundamental for [[Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem|Wiles's proof]] of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], a problem that was stated in terms of [[elementary arithmetic]], and remainded unsolved for several centuries.

In the 7th century BC, the [[Greek mathematics|Greek]] mathematician [[Thales of Miletus]] used geometry to solve problems such as calculating the height of pyramids and the distance of ships from the shore.  He is credited with the first use of deductive reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to [[Thales' theorem]].&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Ionia and the Pythagoreans p. 43"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Ionia and the Pythagoreans" p. 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pythagoras established the [[Pythagoreans|Pythagorean School]], which is credited with the first proof of the [[Pythagorean theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;Eves, Howard, An Introduction to the History of Mathematics, Saunders, 1990, {{ISBN|0-03-029558-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  though the statement of the theorem has a long history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Discovery of Incommensurability by Hippasus of Metapontum|author=Kurt Von Fritz|journal=The Annals of Mathematics|year=1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Pentagram and the Discovery of an Irrational Number|journal=The Two-Year College Mathematics Journal|author=James R.

Around 300 BC, geometry was revolutionized by Euclid, whose ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Euclid of Alexandria" p. 119}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced [[mathematical rigor]] through the [[axiomatic method]] and is the earliest example of the format still used in mathematics today, that of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof. Although most of the contents of the ''Elements'' were already known, Euclid arranged them into a single, coherent logical framework.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Euclid of Alexandria p. 104"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Euclid of Alexandria" p. 104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Elements'' was known to all educated people in the West until the middle of the 20th century and its contents are still taught in geometry classes today.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Eves, ''An Introduction to the History of Mathematics'', Saunders, 1990, {{ISBN|0-03-029558-0}} p. 141: "No work, except [[The Bible]], has been more widely used...."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archimedes]] (c.&amp;nbsp;287–212 BC) of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] used the [[method of exhaustion]] to calculate the [[area]] under the arc of a [[parabola]] with the [[Series (mathematics)|summation of an infinite series]], and gave remarkably accurate approximations of [[Pi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A history of calculus | author1 = O'Connor, J.J. | author2 = Robertson, E.F. | publisher = [[University of St Andrews]] | url = http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/The_rise_of_calculus.html | date = February 1996 | accessdate = 7 August 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070715191704/http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/The_rise_of_calculus.html | archive-date = 15 July 2007 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied the [[Archimedes spiral|spiral]] bearing his name and obtained formulas for the [[volume]]s of [[surface of revolution|surfaces of revolution]].

[[Indian mathematics|Indian]] mathematicians also made many important contributions in geometry. The ''[[Satapatha Brahmana]]'' (3rd century BC) contains rules for ritual geometric constructions that are similar to the ''[[Shulba Sutras|Sulba Sutras]]''.&lt;ref name="Staal 1999"&gt;{{cite journal  | last=Staal  | first=Frits  | author-link=Frits Staal  | title=Greek and Vedic Geometry  | journal=Journal of Indian Philosophy  | volume=27  | issue=1–2  | year=1999  | pages=105–127  | doi=10.1023/A:1004364417713  }}
&lt;/ref&gt; According to {{Harv|Hayashi|2005|p=363}}, the ''Śulba Sūtras'' contain "the earliest extant verbal expression of the Pythagorean Theorem in the world, although it had already been known to the Old Babylonians. They contain lists of [[Pythagorean triples]],&lt;ref&gt;Pythagorean triples are triples of integers &lt;math&gt; (a,b,c) &lt;/math&gt; with the property: &lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2=c^2&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;3^2+4^2=5^2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;8^2+15^2=17^2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;12^2+35^2=37^2&lt;/math&gt; etc.&lt;/ref&gt; which are particular cases of [[Diophantine equations]].&lt;ref name=cooke198&gt;{{Harv|Cooke|2005|p=198}}: "The arithmetic content of the ''Śulva Sūtras'' consists of rules for finding Pythagorean triples such as (3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13), (8, 15, 17), and (12, 35, 37). It is not certain what practical use these arithmetic rules had. The best conjecture is that they were part of religious ritual. A Hindu home was required to have three fires burning at three different altars. The three altars were to be of different shapes, but all three were to have the same area. These conditions led to certain "Diophantine" problems, a particular case of which is the generation of Pythagorean triples, so as to make one square integer equal to the sum of two others."&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[Bakhshali manuscript]], there is a handful of geometric problems (including problems about volumes of irregular solids). The Bakhshali manuscript also "employs a decimal place value system with a dot for zero."&lt;ref name="hayashi2005-371"&gt;{{Harv|Hayashi|2005|p=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aryabhata]]'s ''[[Aryabhatiya]]'' (499) includes the computation of areas and volumes.
[[Brahmagupta]] wrote his astronomical work ''[[Brahmasphutasiddhanta|{{IAST|Brāhma Sphuṭa Siddhānta}}]]'' in 628. Chapter 12, containing 66 [[Sanskrit]] verses, was divided into two sections: "basic operations" (including cube roots, fractions, ratio and proportion, and barter) and "practical mathematics" (including mixture, mathematical series, plane figures, stacking bricks, sawing of timber, and piling of grain).&lt;ref name="hayashi2003-p121-122"&gt;{{Harv|Hayashi|2003|pp=121–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter section, he stated his famous theorem on the diagonals of a [[cyclic quadrilateral]]. Chapter 12 also included a formula for the area of a cyclic quadrilateral (a generalization of [[Heron's formula]]), as well as a complete description of [[rational triangle]]s (''i.e.'' triangles with rational sides and rational areas).&lt;ref name="hayashi2003-p121-122"/&gt;

In the [[Middle Ages]], [[mathematics in medieval Islam]] contributed to the development of geometry, especially [[algebraic geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Rashed (1994), ''The development of Arabic mathematics: between arithmetic and algebra'', p. 35 [[London]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Arabic Hegemony" pp. 241–242}} "Omar Khayyam (c. 1050–1123), the "tent-maker," wrote an ''Algebra'' that went beyond that of al-Khwarizmi to include equations of third degree. Like his Arab predecessors, Omar Khayyam provided for quadratic equations both arithmetic and geometric solutions; for general cubic equations, he believed (mistakenly, as the 16th century later showed), arithmetic solutions were impossible; hence he gave only geometric solutions. The scheme of using intersecting conics to solve cubics had been used earlier by Menaechmus, Archimedes, and Alhazan, but Omar Khayyam took the praiseworthy step of generalizing the method to cover all third-degree equations (having positive roots). .. For equations of higher degree than three, Omar Khayyam evidently did not envision similar geometric methods, for space does not contain more than three dimensions, ... One of the most fruitful contributions of Arabic eclecticism was the tendency to close the gap between numerical and geometric algebra. The decisive step in this direction came much later with Descartes, but Omar Khayyam was moving in this direction when he wrote, "Whoever thinks algebra is a trick in obtaining unknowns has thought it in vain. No attention should be paid to the fact that algebra and geometry are different in appearance. Algebras are geometric facts which are proved."".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Mahani]] (b. 853) conceived the idea of reducing geometrical problems such as duplicating the cube to problems in algebra.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Al-Mahani|title=Al-Mahani|mode=cs1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thābit ibn Qurra]] (known as Thebit in [[Latin]]) (836–901) dealt with [[arithmetic]] operations applied to [[ratio]]s of geometrical quantities, and contributed to the development of [[analytic geometry]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Thabit|title=Al-Sabi Thabit ibn Qurra al-Harrani|mode=cs1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Omar Khayyám]] (1048–1131) found geometric solutions to [[cubic equation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Khayyam|title=Omar Khayyam|mode=cs1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theorems of [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen), Omar Khayyam and [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]] on [[quadrilateral]]s, including the [[Lambert quadrilateral]] and [[Saccheri quadrilateral]], were early results in [[hyperbolic geometry]], and along with their alternative postulates, such as [[Playfair's axiom]], these works had a considerable influence on the development of non-Euclidean geometry among later European geometers, including [[Witelo]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1230–c.&amp;nbsp;1314), [[Gersonides]] (1288–1344), [[Alfonso]], [[John Wallis]], and [[Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri]].{{dubious|reason=this contradicts the assertion (below) that non-Euclidean geometry was discovered only in the 19th century|date=September 2020}}&lt;ref&gt;Boris A.

Youschkevitch (1996), "Geometry", in Roshdi Rashed, ed., ''[[Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science]]'', Vol. 2, pp. 447–494 [470], [[Routledge]], London and New York: {{quote|"Three scientists, Ibn al-Haytham, Khayyam, and al-Tusi, had made the most considerable contribution to this branch of geometry whose importance came to be completely recognized only in the 19th century. In essence, their propositions concerning the properties of quadrangles which they considered, assuming that some of the angles of these figures were acute of obtuse, embodied the first few theorems of the hyperbolic and the elliptic geometries. Their other proposals showed that various geometric statements were equivalent to the Euclidean postulate V. It is extremely important that these scholars established the mutual connection between this postulate and the sum of the angles of a triangle and a quadrangle. By their works on the theory of parallel lines Arab mathematicians directly influenced the relevant investigations of their European counterparts. The first European attempt to prove the postulate on parallel lines – made by Witelo, the Polish scientists of the 13th century, while revising Ibn al-Haytham's ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (''Kitab al-Manazir'') – was undoubtedly prompted by Arabic sources. The proofs put forward in the 14th century by the Jewish scholar Levi ben Gerson, who lived in southern France, and by the above-mentioned Alfonso from Spain directly border on Ibn al-Haytham's demonstration. Above, we have demonstrated that ''Pseudo-Tusi's Exposition of Euclid'' had stimulated both J. Wallis's and G. Saccheri's studies of the theory of parallel lines."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 17th century, there were two important developments in geometry. The first was the creation of analytic geometry, or geometry with [[Coordinate system|coordinates]] and [[equation]]s, by [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) and [[Pierre de Fermat]] (1601–1665).&lt;ref name="Boyer2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl B.

Two of the master geometers of the time were [[Bernhard Riemann]] (1826–1866), working primarily with tools from [[mathematical analysis]], and introducing the [[Riemann surface]], and [[Henri Poincaré]], the founder of [[algebraic topology]] and the geometric theory of [[dynamical system]]s. As a consequence of these major changes in the conception of geometry, the concept of "space" became something rich and varied, and the natural background for theories as different as [[complex analysis]] and [[classical mechanics]].&lt;ref name="Bayro-Corrochano2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eduardo Bayro-Corrochano|title=Geometric Algebra Applications Vol. I: Computer Vision, Graphics and Neurocomputing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SSVhDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4|date=2018|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-74830-6|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there has been some study of geometry without reference to points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerla, G.|year=1995|chapter-url= http://www.dmi.unisa.it/people/gerla/www/Down/point-free.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717210751/http://www.dmi.unisa.it/people/gerla/www/Down/point-free.pdf|archive-date=17 July 2011|chapter=Pointless Geometries|editor=Buekenhout, F.|editor2=Kantor, W.|title=Handbook of incidence geometry: buildings and foundations|publisher=North-Holland|pages=1015–1031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lines===
{{main|Line (geometry)}}

[[Euclid]] described a line as "breadthless length" which "lies equally with respect to the points on itself".&lt;ref name=EuclidAll /&gt; In modern mathematics, given the multitude of geometries, the concept of a line is closely tied to the way the geometry is described.

===Planes===
{{main|Plane (geometry)}}

A [[plane (geometry)|plane]] is a flat, two-dimensional surface that extends infinitely far.&lt;ref name= EuclidAll /&gt; Planes are used in every area of geometry. For instance, planes can be studied as a [[surface (topology)|topological surface]] without reference to distances or angles;&lt;ref name=Munkres&gt;Munkres, James R. Topology. Vol. 2.

''Complex analysis: an introduction to the theory of analytic functions of one complex variable.'' New York, London (1953).&lt;/ref&gt; and so on.

===Angles===
{{main|Angle}}

[[Euclid]] defines a plane [[angle]] as the inclination to each other, in a plane, of two lines which meet each other, and do not lie straight with respect to each other.&lt;ref name= EuclidAll /&gt; In modern terms, an angle is the figure formed by two [[Ray (geometry)|rays]], called the ''sides'' of the angle, sharing a common endpoint, called the ''[[vertex (geometry)|vertex]]'' of the angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{SpringerEOM|id=Angle&amp;oldid=13323|title=Angle|year=2001|last=Sidorov|first=L.A.|mode=cs1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Angle obtuse acute straight.svg|thumb|Acute (a), obtuse (b), and straight (c) angles. The acute and obtuse angles are also known as oblique angles.]]

In [[Euclidean geometry]], angles are used to study [[polygon]]s and [[triangle]]s, as well as forming an object of study in their own right.&lt;ref name= EuclidAll /&gt; The study of the angles of a triangle or of angles in a [[unit circle]] forms the basis of [[trigonometry]].&lt;ref&gt;Gelʹfand, Izrailʹ Moiseevič, and Mark Saul.

===Curves===
{{main|Curve (geometry)}}

A [[curve (geometry)|curve]] is a 1-dimensional object that may be straight (like a line) or not; curves in 2-dimensional space are called [[plane curve]]s and those in 3-dimensional space are called [[space curve]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Henry Frederick. Principles of geometry. Vol. 2. CUP Archive, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

In topology, a curve is defined by a function from an interval of the real numbers to another space.&lt;ref name = Munkres /&gt; In differential geometry, the same definition is used, but the defining function is required to be differentiable &lt;ref name = Carmo /&gt; Algebraic geometry studies [[algebraic curve]]s, which are defined as [[algebraic varieties]] of [[dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]] one.&lt;ref name = mumford /&gt;

===Manifolds===
{{main | Manifold}}

A [[manifold]] is a generalization of the concepts of curve and surface. In [[topology]], a manifold is a [[topological space]] where every point has a [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] that is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to Euclidean space.&lt;ref name = Munkres /&gt; In [[differential geometry]], a [[differentiable manifold]] is a space where each neighborhood is [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to Euclidean space.&lt;ref name=Carmo/&gt;

In [[Euclidean geometry]] and [[analytic geometry]], the length of a line segment can often be calculated by the [[Pythagorean theorem]].&lt;ref name="Cannon2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=James W.

Area and volume can be defined as fundamental quantities separate from length, or they can be described and calculated in terms of lengths in a plane or 3-dimensional space.&lt;ref name="Treese2018"/&gt; Mathematicians have found many explicit [[Area#List of formulas|formulas for area]] and [[Volume#Volume formulas|formulas for volume]] of various geometric objects.

The concept of length or distance can be generalized, leading to the idea of [[metric space|metrics]].&lt;ref&gt;Dmitri Burago, [[Yuri Dmitrievich Burago|Yu D Burago]], Sergei Ivanov, ''A Course in Metric Geometry'', American Mathematical Society, 2001, {{ISBN|0-8218-2129-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the [[Euclidean metric]] measures the distance between points in the [[Euclidean plane]], while the [[hyperbolic metric]] measures the distance in the [[hyperbolic plane]]. Other important examples of metrics include the [[Lorentz metric]] of [[special relativity]] and the semi-[[Riemannian metric]]s of [[general relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wald|first=Robert M.|authorlink=Robert Wald|title=General Relativity|publisher=University of Chicago Press|date=1984|isbn=978-0-226-87033-5|title-link=General Relativity (book)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a different direction, the concepts of length, area and volume are extended by [[measure theory]], which studies methods of assigning a size or ''measure'' to [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], where the measures follow rules similar to those of classical area and volume.&lt;ref name="Tao2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Terence Tao|title=An Introduction to Measure Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HoGDAwAAQBAJ|date=14 September 2011|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|isbn=978-0-8218-6919-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congruence and similarity===
{{main|Congruence (geometry)|Similarity (geometry)}}

[[Congruence (geometry)|Congruence]] and [[Similarity (geometry)|similarity]] are concepts that describe when two shapes have similar characteristics.&lt;ref name="Libeskind2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shlomo Libeskind|title=Euclidean and Transformational Geometry: A Deductive Inquiry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=et6WMlkQlFcC&amp;pg=PA255|date=12 February 2008|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-0-7637-4366-6|page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Euclidean geometry, similarity is used to describe objects that have the same shape, while congruence is used to describe objects that are the same in both size and shape.&lt;ref name="Freitag2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark A. Freitag|title=Mathematics for Elementary School Teachers: A Process Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G4BVGFiVKG0C&amp;pg=PA614|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-618-61008-2|page=614}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hilbert]], in his work on creating a more rigorous foundation for geometry, treated congruence as an undefined term whose properties are defined by [[axiom]]s.

Congruence and similarity are generalized in [[transformation geometry]], which studies the properties of geometric objects that are preserved by different kinds of transformations.&lt;ref name="Martin2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=George E.

===Compass and straightedge constructions===
{{Main|Compass and straightedge constructions}}

Classical geometers paid special attention to constructing geometric objects that had been described in some other way. Classically, the only instruments allowed in geometric constructions are the [[Compass (drafting)|compass]] and [[ruler|straightedge]]. Also, every construction had to be complete in a finite number of steps. However, some problems turned out to be difficult or impossible to solve by these means alone, and ingenious constructions using parabolas and other curves, as well as mechanical devices, were found.

===Dimension===
{{main|Dimension}}

[[File:Von Koch curve.gif|thumb|The [[Koch snowflake]], with [[fractal dimension]]=log4/log3 and [[topological dimension]]=1]]
Where the traditional geometry allowed dimensions 1 (a [[line (geometry)|line]]), 2 (a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]]) and 3 (our ambient world conceived of as [[three-dimensional space]]), mathematicians and physicists have used [[higher dimension]]s for nearly two centuries.&lt;ref name="Blacklock2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Blacklock|title=The Emergence of the Fourth Dimension: Higher Spatial Thinking in the Fin de Siècle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nrNSDwAAQBAJ|year=2018|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-875548-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of a mathematical use for higher dimensions is the [[configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] of a physical system, which has a dimension equal to the system's [[degrees of freedom]]. For instance, the configuration of a screw can be described by five coordinates.&lt;ref name="Joly1895"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Jasper Joly|title=Papers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cOTuAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA62|year=1895|publisher=The Academy|pages=62–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[general topology]], the concept of dimension has been extended from [[natural number]]s, to infinite dimension ([[Hilbert space]]s, for example) and  positive [[real number]]s (in [[fractal geometry]]).&lt;ref name="Temam2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger Temam|title=Infinite-Dimensional Dynamical Systems in Mechanics and Physics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OB_vBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA367|date=11 December 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4612-0645-3|page=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[algebraic geometry]], the [[dimension of an algebraic variety]] has received a number of apparently different definitions, which are all equivalent in the most common cases.&lt;ref name="JacobLam1994"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bill Jacob|author2=Tsit-Yuen Lam|title=Recent Advances in Real Algebraic Geometry and Quadratic Forms: Proceedings of the RAGSQUAD Year, Berkeley, 1990-1991|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mHwcCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA111|year=1994|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|isbn=978-0-8218-5154-8|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symmetry===
{{main |Symmetry}}

[[File:Order-3 heptakis heptagonal tiling.png|right|thumb|A [[Order-3 bisected heptagonal tiling|tiling]] of the [[Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]]]]

A different type of symmetry is the principle of [[Duality (projective geometry)|duality]]  in [[projective geometry]], among other fields.

====Non-Euclidean geometry====
{{main|Non-Euclidean geometry}}

Euclidean geometry was not the only historical form of geometry studied. [[Spherical geometry]] has long been used by astronomers, astrologers, and navigators.&lt;ref name="Rosenfeld2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Boris A. Rosenfeld|title=A History of Non-Euclidean Geometry: Evolution of the Concept of a Geometric Space|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3wzSBwAAQBAJ|date=8 September 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4419-8680-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant]] argued that there is only one, ''absolute'', geometry, which is known to be true ''a priori'' by an inner faculty of mind: Euclidean geometry was [[synthetic a priori]].&lt;ref&gt;Kline (1972) "Mathematical thought from ancient to modern times", Oxford University Press, p. 1032.  Kant did not reject the logical (analytic a priori) ''possibility'' of non-Euclidean geometry, see [[Jeremy Gray]], "Ideas of Space Euclidean, Non-Euclidean, and Relativistic", Oxford, 1989; p. 85.  Some have implied that, in light of this, Kant had in fact ''predicted'' the development of non-Euclidean geometry, cf. Leonard Nelson, "Philosophy and Axiomatics," Socratic Method and Critical Philosophy, Dover, 1965, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;  This view was at first somewhat challenged by thinkers such as [[Saccheri]], then finally overturned by the revolutionary discovery of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] in the works of Bolyai, Lobachevsky, and Gauss (who never published his theory).&lt;ref name="Sommerville1919"&gt;{{cite book|author=Duncan M'Laren Young Sommerville|title=Elements of Non-Euclidean Geometry ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6eASAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA15|year=1919|publisher=Open Court|pages=15ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; They demonstrated that ordinary [[Euclidean space]] is only one possibility for development of geometry. A broad vision of the subject of geometry was then expressed  by [[Riemann]] in his 1867 inauguration lecture ''Über die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen'' (''On the hypotheses on which geometry is based''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Riemann/Geom/ |title=Ueber die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318034045/http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Riemann/Geom/ |archivedate=18 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; published only after his death. Riemann's new idea of space proved crucial in [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[general relativity theory]]. [[Riemannian geometry]], which considers very general spaces in which the notion of length is defined, is a mainstay of modern geometry.&lt;ref name="Pesic2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Pesic|title=Beyond Geometry: Classic Papers from Riemann to Einstein|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z67x6IOuOUAC|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=978-0-486-45350-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complex geometry===
{{Main|Complex geometry}}
[[Complex geometry]] studies the nature of geometric structures modelled on, or arising out of, the [[complex plane]].&lt;ref&gt;Huybrechts, D. (2006). Complex geometry: an introduction. Springer Science &amp; Business Media.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, P., &amp; Harris, J. (2014). Principles of algebraic geometry. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wells, R. O. N., &amp; García-Prada, O. (1980). Differential analysis on complex manifolds (Vol. 21980). New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Complex geometry lies at the intersection of differential geometry, algebraic geometry, and analysis of [[several complex variables]], and has found applications to [[string theory]] and [[Mirror symmetry (string theory)|mirror symmetry]].&lt;ref&gt;
Hori, K., Thomas, R., Katz, S., Vafa, C., Pandharipande, R., Klemm, A., ... &amp; Zaslow, E. (2003). Mirror symmetry (Vol. 1). American Mathematical Soc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Complex geometry first appeared as a distinct area of study in the work of [[Bernhard Riemann]] in his study of [[Riemann surface]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Forster, O. (2012). Lectures on Riemann surfaces (Vol. 81). Springer Science &amp; Business Media.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miranda, R. (1995). Algebraic curves and Riemann surfaces (Vol. 5). American Mathematical Soc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, S. (2011). Riemann surfaces. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Work in the spirit of Riemann was carried out by the [[Italian school of algebraic geometry]] in the early 1900s. Contemporary treatment of complex geometry began with the work of [[Jean-Pierre Serre]], who introduced the concept of [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] to the subject, and illuminated the relations between complex geometry and algebraic geometry.&lt;ref&gt;Serre, J. P. (1955). Faisceaux algébriques cohérents. Annals of Mathematics, 197-278.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Serre, J. P. (1956). Géométrie algébrique et géométrie analytique. In Annales de l'Institut Fourier (Vol. 6, pp. 1-42).&lt;/ref&gt;
The primary objects of study in complex geometry are [[complex manifold]]s, [[complex algebraic varieties]], and [[complex analytic varieties]], and [[holomorphic vector bundles]] and [[coherent sheaves]] over these spaces. Special examples of spaces studied in complex geometry include Riemann surfaces, and [[Calabi-Yau manifold]]s, and these spaces find uses in string theory. In particular, [[worldsheet]]s of strings are modelled by Riemann surfaces, and [[superstring theory]] predicts that the extra 6 dimensions of 10 dimensional [[spacetime]] may be modelled by Calabi-Yau manifolds.

===Discrete geometry===
{{main|Discrete geometry}}
[[File:Closepacking.svg|thumb|Discrete geometry includes the study of various [[sphere packing]]s.]]
[[Discrete geometry]] is a subject that has close connections with [[convex geometry]].&lt;ref name="Matoušek2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jiří Matoušek|title=Lectures on Discrete Geometry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K0fhBwAAQBAJ|date=1 December 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4613-0039-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zong2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chuanming Zong|title=The Cube-A Window to Convex and Discrete Geometry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ola6htFUQ1IC|date=2 February 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85535-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gruber2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter M.

Examples include the study of [[sphere packing]]s, [[triangulation (geometry)|triangulations]], the Kneser-Poulsen conjecture, etc.&lt;ref name="DevadossO'Rourke2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Satyan L. Devadoss|author2=Joseph O'Rourke|title=Discrete and Computational Geometry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=InJL6iAaIQQC|date=11 April 2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-3898-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bezdek2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Károly Bezdek|title=Classical Topics in Discrete Geometry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tov0d9VMOfMC|date=23 June 2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4419-0600-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shares many methods and principles with [[combinatorics]].

===Computational geometry===
{{main|Computational geometry}}
[[Computational geometry]] deals with [[algorithm]]s and their [[implementation (computer science)|implementations]] for manipulating geometrical objects. Important problems historically have included the [[travelling salesman problem]], [[minimum spanning tree]]s, [[hidden-line removal]], and [[linear programming]].&lt;ref name="PreparataShamos2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Franco P. Preparata|author2=Michael I. Shamos|title=Computational Geometry: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_p3eBwAAQBAJ|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4612-1098-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although being a young area of geometry, it has many applications in [[computer vision]], [[image processing]], [[computer-aided design]], [[medical imaging]], etc.&lt;ref name="GuYau2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Xianfeng David Gu|author2=Shing-Tung Yau|title=Computational Conformal Geometry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4FDvAAAAMAAJ|year=2008|publisher=International Press|isbn=978-1-57146-171-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geometric group theory===
{{main|Geometric group theory}}
[[Image:Cayley graph of F2.svg|right|thumb|The Cayley graph of the [[free group]] on two generators ''a'' and ''b'']]
[[Geometric group theory]] uses large-scale geometric techniques to study [[finitely generated group]]s.&lt;ref name="Löh2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Clara Löh|title=Geometric Group Theory: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AxEDwAAQBAJ|date=19 December 2017|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-72254-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely connected to [[low-dimensional topology]], such as in [[Grigori Perelman]]'s proof of the [[Geometrization conjecture]], which included the proof of the [[Poincaré conjecture]], a [[Millennium Prize Problems|Millennium Prize Problem]].&lt;ref name="MorganTian2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Morgan|author2=Gang Tian|title=The Geometrization Conjecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qv2cAwAAQBAJ|date=21 May 2014|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|isbn=978-0-8218-5201-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geometric group theory often revolves around the [[Cayley graph]], which is a geometric representation of a group. Other important topics include [[quasi-isometry|quasi-isometries]], [[Gromov-hyperbolic group]]s, and [[right angled Artin group]]s.&lt;ref name="Löh2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wise2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel T. Wise|title=From Riches to Raags: 3-Manifolds, Right-Angled Artin Groups, and Cubical Geometry: 3-manifolds, Right-angled Artin Groups, and Cubical Geometry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GsTW5oQhRPkC|year=2012|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|isbn=978-0-8218-8800-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convex geometry===
{{main|Convex geometry}}

[[Convex geometry]] investigates [[convex set|convex]] shapes in the Euclidean space and its more abstract analogues, often using techniques of [[real analysis]] and [[discrete mathematics]].&lt;ref name="Meurant2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerard Meurant|title=Handbook of Convex Geometry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2viBQAAQBAJ|date=28 June 2014|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-0-08-093439-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has close connections to [[convex analysis]], [[optimization]] and [[functional analysis]] and important applications in [[number theory]].

Convex geometry dates back to antiquity.&lt;ref name="Meurant2014"/&gt; [[Archimedes]] gave the first known precise definition of convexity. The [[isoperimetric problem]], a recurring concept in convex geometry, was studied by the Greeks as well, including [[Zenodorus (mathematician)|Zenodorus]]. Archimedes, [[Plato]], [[Euclid]], and later [[Kepler]] and [[Coxeter]] all studied [[convex polytope]]s and their properties. From the 19th century on, mathematicians have studied other areas of convex mathematics, including higher-dimensional polytopes, volume and surface area of convex bodies, [[Gaussian curvature]], [[algorithms]], [[tiling (geometry)|tilings]] and [[lattice (group)|lattice]]s.

==Applications==
Geometry has found applications in many fields, some of which are described below.

===Art===
{{main |Mathematics and art}}
[[File:Fes Medersa Bou Inania Mosaique2.jpg|thumb|Bou Inania Madrasa, Fes, Morocco, zellige mosaic tiles forming elaborate geometric tessellations]]
Mathematics and art are related in a variety of ways. For instance, the theory of [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] showed that there is more to geometry than just the metric properties of figures: perspective is the origin of [[projective geometry]].&lt;ref name="Richter-Gebert2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jürgen Richter-Gebert|title=Perspectives on Projective Geometry: A Guided Tour Through Real and Complex Geometry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F_NP8Kub2XYC|date=4 February 2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-17286-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists have long used concepts of [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]] in design. [[Vitruvius]] developed a complicated theory of ''ideal proportions'' for the human figure.&lt;ref name="Elam2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kimberly Elam|title=Geometry of Design: Studies in Proportion and Composition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JXIEz2XYnp8C|year=2001|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|isbn=978-1-56898-249-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These concepts have been used and adapted by artists from [[Michelangelo]] to modern comic book artists.&lt;ref name="Guigar2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brad J. Guigar|title=The Everything Cartooning Book: Create Unique And Inspired Cartoons For Fun And Profit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7gftDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT82|date=4 November 2004|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=978-1-4405-2305-2|pages=82–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[golden ratio]] is a particular proportion that has had a controversial role in art. Often claimed to be the most aesthetically pleasing ratio of lengths, it is frequently stated to be incorporated into famous works of art, though the most reliable and unambiguous examples were made deliberately by artists aware of this legend.&lt;ref name="Livio2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mario Livio|title=The Golden Ratio: The Story of PHI, the World's Most Astonishing Number|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bUARfgWRH14C&amp;pg=PA166|date=12 November 2008|publisher=Crown/Archetype|isbn=978-0-307-48552-6|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tiling (geometry)|Tilings]], or tessellations, have been used in art throughout history. [[Islamic art]] makes frequent use of tessellations, as did the art of [[Escher]].&lt;ref name="EmmerSchattschneider2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michele Emmer|author2=Doris Schattschneider|title=M.C. Escher's Legacy: A Centennial Celebration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5DDyBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA107|date=8 May 2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-28849-7|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escher's work also made use of [[hyperbolic geometry]].

[[Cézanne]] advanced the theory that all images can be built up from the [[sphere]], the [[cone]], and the [[cylinder]]. This is still used in art theory today, although the exact list of shapes varies from author to author.&lt;ref name="CapitoloSchwab2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Capitolo|author2=Ken Schwab|title=Drawing Course 101|url=https://archive.org/details/drawingcourse1010000capi|url-access=registration|year=2004|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4027-0383-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/drawingcourse1010000capi/page/22 22]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gelineau2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Phyllis Gelineau|title=Integrating the Arts Across the Elementary School Curriculum|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Ib0mUl_VhwC&amp;pg=PA55|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-111-30126-2|pages=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
{{main|Mathematics and architecture|Architectural geometry}}

Geometry has many applications in architecture. In fact, it has been said that geometry lies at the core of architectural design.&lt;ref name="CeccatoHesselgren2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cristiano Ceccato|author2=Lars Hesselgren|author3=Mark Pauly|author4=Helmut Pottmann, Johannes Wallner|title=Advances in Architectural Geometry 2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q45sDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6|date=5 December 2016|publisher=Birkhäuser|isbn=978-3-99043-371-3|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pottmann2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Helmut Pottmann|title=Architectural geometry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bIceAQAAIAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Bentley Institute Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applications of geometry to architecture include the use of [[projective geometry]] to create [[forced perspective]],&lt;ref name="MoffettFazio2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marian Moffett|author2=Michael W. Fazio|author3=Lawrence Wodehouse|title=A World History of Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IFMohetegAcC&amp;pg=PT371|year=2003|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|isbn=978-1-85669-371-4|page=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; the use of [[conic section]]s in constructing domes and similar objects,&lt;ref name="HerseyHersey2001" /&gt; the use of [[tessellations]],&lt;ref name="HerseyHersey2001"/&gt; and the use of symmetry.&lt;ref name="HerseyHersey2001"/&gt;

===Physics===
{{main|Mathematical physics}}

The field of [[astronomy]], especially as it relates to mapping the positions of [[star]]s and [[planet]]s on the [[celestial sphere]] and describing the relationship between movements of celestial bodies, have served as an important source of geometric problems throughout history.&lt;ref name="GreenGreen1985"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robin M. Green|author2=Robin Michael Green|title=Spherical Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wOpaUFQFwTwC&amp;pg=PA1|date=31 October 1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-31779-5|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Riemannian geometry]] and [[pseudo-Riemannian]] geometry are used in [[general relativity]].&lt;ref name="Alekseevskiĭ2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dmitriĭ Vladimirovich Alekseevskiĭ|title=Recent Developments in Pseudo-Riemannian Geometry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K6-TgxMKu4QC|year=2008|publisher=European Mathematical Society|isbn=978-3-03719-051-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[String theory]] makes use of several variants of geometry,&lt;ref name="YauNadis2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Shing-Tung Yau|author2=Steve Nadis|title=The Shape of Inner Space: String Theory and the Geometry of the Universe's Hidden Dimensions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M40Ytp8Os_gC|date=7 September 2010|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-02266-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does [[quantum information theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bengtsson |first1=Ingemar |last2=Życzkowski |first2=Karol |authorlink2=Karol Życzkowski |title=Geometry of Quantum States: An Introduction to Quantum Entanglement |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |edition=2nd |year=2017 |isbn=9781107026254 |oclc=1004572791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other fields of mathematics===
[[File:Square root of 2 triangle.svg|thumb|right|The Pythagoreans discovered that the sides of a  triangle could have [[Commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurable]] lengths.]]

[[Calculus]] was strongly influenced by geometry.&lt;ref name="Boyer2012"/&gt; For instance, the introduction of [[coordinates]] by [[René Descartes]] and the concurrent developments of [[algebra]] marked a new stage for geometry, since geometric figures such as [[plane curve]]s could now be represented [[analytic geometry|analytically]] in the form of functions and equations. This played a key role in the emergence of [[infinitesimal calculus]] in the 17th century. Analytic geometry continues to be a mainstay of pre-calculus and calculus curriculum.&lt;ref name="FlandersPrice2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harley Flanders|author2=Justin J. Price|title=Calculus with Analytic Geometry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5abiBQAAQBAJ|date=10 May 2014|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-1-4832-6240-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RogawskiAdams2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jon Rogawski|author2=Colin Adams|title=Calculus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OWeZBgAAQBAJ|date=30 January 2015|publisher=W. H. Freeman|isbn=978-1-4641-7499-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important area of application is [[number theory]].&lt;ref name="Lozano-Robledo2019"&gt;{{cite book|author=Álvaro Lozano-Robledo|title=Number Theory and Geometry: An Introduction to Arithmetic Geometry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ESiODwAAQBAJ|date=21 March 2019|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|isbn=978-1-4704-5016-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ancient Greece]] the [[Pythagoreans]] considered the role of numbers in geometry. However, the discovery of incommensurable lengths contradicted their philosophical views.&lt;ref name="Sangalli2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arturo Sangalli|title=Pythagoras' Revenge: A Mathematical Mystery|url=https://archive.org/details/pythagorasreveng0000sang|url-access=registration|date=10 May 2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-04955-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/pythagorasreveng0000sang/page/57 57]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 19th century, geometry has been used for solving problems in number theory, for example through the [[geometry of numbers]] or, more recently, [[scheme theory]], which is used in [[Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem]].&lt;ref name="CornellSilverman2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gary Cornell|author2=Joseph H.

In three-dimensional space, a '''regulus''' ''R'' is a set of [[skew lines]], every point of which is on a [[transversal (combinatorics)|transversal]] which intersects an element of ''R'' only once, and such that every point on a transversal lies on a line of ''R'' 

The set of transversals of ''R'' forms an '''opposite regulus''' ''S''. In ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; the union ''R'' ∪ ''S'' is the [[ruled surface]] of a [[hyperboloid of one sheet]].

Three skew lines determine a regulus:
:The locus of lines meeting three given skew lines is called a ''regulus''. [[Skew lines#Gallucci's theorem|Gallucci's theorem]] shows that the lines meeting the generators of the regulus (including the original three lines) form another "associated" regulus, such that every generator of either regulus meets every generator of the other. The two reguli are the two systems of generators of a ''ruled quadric''.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. S. M. Coxeter]] (1969) ''Introduction to Geometry'', page 259, [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Charlotte Scott]], "The regulus supplies extremely simple proofs of the properties of a conic...the theorems of Chasles, [[Brianchon's theorem|Brianchon]], and [[Pascal's theorem|Pascal]] ..."&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Angas Scott (1905) [http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1905-12-01/S0002-9904-1905-01279-9/S0002-9904-1905-01279-9.pdf The elementary treatment of the conics by means of the regulus], [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] 12(1): 1–7&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[finite geometry]] PG(3, ''q''), a regulus has ''q'' + 1 lines.&lt;ref&gt;[[Albrecht Beutelspacher]] &amp; Ute Rosenbaum (1998) ''Projective Geometry'', page 72, [[Cambridge University Press]]  {{ISBN|0-521-48277-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1954 [[William Edge (mathematician)|William Edge]] described a pair of reguli of four lines each in PG(3,3).&lt;ref&gt;[[W. L. Edge]] (1954) "Geometry of three dimensions over GF(3)", [[Proceedings of the Royal Society]] A 222: 262–86 {{doi|10.1098/rspa.1954.0068}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert J. T. Bell]] described how the regulus is generated by a moving straight line. First, the hyperboloid &lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} - \frac{z^2}{c^2} \ = \ 1&lt;/math&gt; is factored as
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{x}{a} + \frac{z}{c}\right) \left(\frac{x}{a} - \frac{z}{c}\right) \ =\  \left(1 + \frac{y}{b}\right) \left(1 - \frac{y}{b}\right) .&lt;/math&gt; 
Then two systems of lines, parametrized by &amp;lambda; and &amp;mu; satisfy this equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{a} + \frac{z}{c} \ =\ \lambda \left(1 + \frac{y}{b}\right), \quad \frac{x}{a} - \frac{z}{c} \ =\ \frac{1}{\lambda} \left(1 - \frac{y}{b}\right) &lt;/math&gt; and 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{a} - \frac{z}{c} \ =\ \mu \left(1 + \frac{y}{b}\right), \quad \frac{x}{a} + \frac{z}{c} \ =\ \frac{1}{\mu} \left(1 - \frac{y}{b}\right) .&lt;/math&gt;
No member of the first set of lines is a member of the second. As &amp;lambda; or &amp;mu; varies, the hyperboloid is generated. The two sets represent a regulus and its opposite. Using [[analytic geometry]], Bell proves that no two generators in a set intersect, and that any two generators in opposite reguli do intersect and form the plane tangent to the hyperboloid at that point. (page 155).&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert J. T. Bell]] (1910) [https://archive.org/details/elementarytreati033329mbp/page/n119 An Elementary Treatise on Co-ordinate Geometry of Three Dimensions], page 148, via [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''secant plane''' is a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] containing a nontrivial [[Cross section (geometry)|section]] of a [[sphere]] or an [[ellipsoid]], or such a plane that a sphere is projected onto. Secant planes are similar to tangent planes, which contact the sphere's surface at a point, while secant planes contact the surface along curves.

The two-dimensional representations of secant planes are [[secant line]]s, the lines that join two distinct points on a curve.

== Applications ==
{{comparison_of_cartography_surface_development.svg|300px}}
Secant planes are used in [[map projection]]s. The secant plane intersects a globe along a small circle with no distortion, forming a [[Standard parallel (map projections)|standard parallel]] which has true scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://geokov.com/education/map-projection.aspx|title=Map projection - types and distortion|last=|first=|website=geokov.com|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="1119" xml:space="preserve">In mathematics, a '''twisted sheaf'''  is a variant of a [[coherent sheaf]]. Precisely, it is specified by: an open covering in the étale topology ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, coherent sheaves ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; over ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, a Čech 2-cocycle ''θ'' on the covering ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; as well as the isomorphisms
:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij}: F_j|_{U_{ij}} \overset{\sim}\to F_i|_{U_{ij}} &lt;/math&gt;
satisfying
*&lt;math&gt;g_{ii} = \operatorname{id}_{F_i}&lt;/math&gt;,
*&lt;math&gt;g_{ij} = g_{ji}^{-1},&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;g_{ij} \circ g_{jk} \circ g_{ki} = \theta_{ijk} \operatorname{id}_{F_i}.&lt;/math&gt;

The notion of twisted sheaves was introduced by Giraud. The above definition due to Căldăraru is down-to-earth but is equivalent to a more sophisticated definition in terms of [[gerbe]]; see § 2.1.3 of {{harv|Lieblich|2007}}.

      <text bytes="27768" xml:space="preserve">The '''volume''' (W) and '''displacement''' (Δ) indicators have been discovered by [[Philippe Samyn]] in 1997 to help the search for the optimal geometry of architectural structures.

== The architectural structure ==
A resistant structure is anything amorphous or living, which supports the forces to which it is normally subjected without breaking. 
 
Characterised by its shape and its constituent materials, and three-dimensional by nature, the amorphous structure usually has a two-dimensional geometry, which is given a thickness, or a three-dimensional geometry (the three-dimensional structure). The latter is formed of a pair of two-dimensional structures on non-parallel planes or three-dimensional curved volumes as in the case for any living things, including a specific group: the shells (a three-dimensional surface with a thickness). An example of these is the structure of cars, boats or planes, or even human skulls, sea shells or the stem of a dandelion. 
 
The geometry of most "architectural" structures (such as buildings or bridges) is two-dimensional and it is essential to study this aspect, whether for aesthetic, commodity-related or economic reasons. Several criteria are therefore taken into account in its definition.

== Objective ==
The study is limited to the quest of the geometry giving the structure of minimum volume.

The cost of a structure depends on the nature and the quantity of the materials used as well as the tools and human resources required for its production.

Although technological progress has reduced the cost of tools and the amount of human resources required, and despite the fact that computerised calculation tools can now be used to determine the dimension of a structure so that the load it bears at every point is within the admissible limits allowed by its constituent materials, it is also necessary for its geometry to be optimal. It is far from simple to find this optimal point because the choice available is so vast.

Furthermore, the resistance of the structure is not the only criterion to take into account. In many cases, it is also important to ensure that it will not undergo excessive deformation under static loads or that it does not vibrate to inconvenient or dangerous levels when subjected to dynamic loads.

Volume and displacement indicators, W and Δ, discovered by Philippe Samyn in August 1997, are useful tools in this regard. This approach does not take into account phenomena of elastic instability. Indeed, it can be shown that it is always possible to design a structure so that this effect becomes negligible.

== The indicators ==

The objective is to ascertain the optimal morphology for a two-dimensional structure with constant thickness, which:
* fits in a rectangle of pre-determined dimensions, longitudinal L and horizontal H, expressed in metres (m); 
* is made of one (or several) material(s) with a modulus of elasticity E, expressed in Pascals (Pa), and bearing a load at all points within its allowable stress(es) σ, expressed in Pascals (Pa);
* is resistant to the maximum loads to which it is subjected, in the form of a “resultant” F, expressed in Newtons (N).

Each form chosen corresponds to a volume of material V (in m³) and a maximum deformation δ (in m). 
Their calculation depends on the factors L, H, E, σ and F. These calculations are long and tedious, they cloud the objective of finding the optimal form.

It is, nevertheless, possible to overcome this problem by setting each factor to unity: while all other characteristics remain the same. Length L is therefore set to 1m, H to H/L, E and σ to 1Pa, and F to 1N.
This "reduced" structure has a volume of material W= σV/ FL (the volume indicator) and a maximum deformation Δ = Eδ / σL (the displacement indicator). Their main characteristic is that they are numbers without physical dimensions (dimensionless) and their value, for every morphology considered, depends only on the ratio L/H, i.e. the geometric slenderness ratio of the form.

This method can easily be applied to three-dimensional structures as illustrated in the following examples.

The theory related to the indicators has been taught since 2000, and among other institutions, at the department of Civil Engineering and of Architecture at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB ; section "material mechanics and constructions") leading to research and publications under the direction of Prof. Dr. Ir. Philippe Samyn (from 2000 to 2006); Prof. Dr. Ir. Willy Patrick De Wilde (from 2000 to 2011) and now Prof. Dr. Ir. Lincy Pyl.
 
The "reference book",&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Samyn, ''Étude de la morphologie des structures à l’aide des indicateurs de volume et de déplacement'', Académie royale de Belgique, Bruxelles, 2004, 482 p; www.samynandpartners.com (for online e-book), ({{ISBN|2-8031-0201-3}}).&lt;/ref&gt; since the reference thesis,&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Samyn, ''Étude comparée du volume et du déplacement de structures bidimensionnelles, sous charges verticales entre deux appuis vers un outil d'évaluation et de prédimensionnement des structures'', Tome I: Mémoire, 175 p.; Tome II: Annexes, 184 p.; Tome III: Figures, 197 p. (4th of July 1999) ; Tome IV: Epilogue, 33 p. + 14 figures (1st of December 1999). PhD Thesis in Applied Sciences, University of Liège.&lt;/ref&gt; reports the developments of the theory at Samyn and Partners as well as the VUB, up to 2004.

The theory is open to everyone who wants to contribute, W and Δ being to be calculated for any resistant structure as defined in paragraph 1 here above. 
 
Progresses in material sciences, robotics and three dimensional printing, lead to the creation of new structural forms lighter than anyone known today. 
 
The geometry of minimal surfaces of constant thickness in a homogeneous material is, for example, substantially modified when thickness and/or local allowable stress are varying.

== Macrostructure, structural element, microstructure and material ==

The macrostructures considered here may be composed of "structural elements" which material presents a "microstructure".

Whether searching to limit the stress or the deformation, macrostructure, structural element and microstructure have each, a weight ''Vρ'', when ''ρ'' is the volumic weight of materials, in N/m³, function of the solicitations {''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;} (for "force" in général) applied to them, of their size {''L''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;} (for length or "size" in general) , of their shape {''G&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''} (for geometry or "shape" in general), and of their constituting material {''M&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''} (for "material" in general).
{{clear}}
: &lt;math&gt;V\rho \div \{F_0\}\{L_0\}\{G_e\}\{M_a\}&lt;/math&gt;
{{clear}}
It can also be expressed as shape and material ({''G&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''}{''M&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''}) defining the weight (''Vρ'') for the structure of a given size under given force ({''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}{''L''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}). 
{{clear}}
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{V\rho}{\{F_0\} \{L_0\}} \div \{G_e\} \{M_a\}&lt;/math&gt;
{{clear}}
In material mechanics and for the structural elements under a specific loading case, the factor  {''G&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''} corresponds to the "form factor" for elements of continuous section out of a solid material (without voids).

The constituting material might however present a microstructure with voids. This cellular structure enhances than the form factor, whatever the loading case.

The factor {''M&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''} characterizes a material which efficiency might be compared to another for a given loading case, and the independently of the form factor {''G&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''}.

The indicators ''W'' = ''σV''/''FL'' and Δ = ''δE''/''σL'' just defined, characterize the macrostructures, while the same notations and symbols in small letters, ''w'' = ''σv''/''fl'' and Δ = ''δE''/''σl'', refer to the structural element.

The figure 1 gives the values of ''W'' and Δ for the structural element subject to traction, compression, bending and shear. The left column relates to the limitation of stress and the right column to the limitation of deformation. It shows the direct relation of ''W'' to {''G&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''}{''M&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''} as:
{{clear}}
: &lt;math&gt;V\rho \div \{F_0\}\{L_0\}\{G_e\}\{M_a\} \div V\sigma \cdot \rho/\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, thus &lt;math&gt;V\sigma \div \{F_0\}\{L_0\}\{G_e\}\{M_a\} \cdot \sigma/\rho .&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;W=\frac{\sigma V}{FL} \div \left[\frac{\{F_0\}} F\right] \left[\frac{\{L_0\}} L \right] \{G_e\}\{M_a\} \frac\sigma\rho,&lt;/math&gt;
or
: &lt;math&gt;W\div\{G_e\}\{M_a\}\sigma/\rho&lt;/math&gt; for given dimensions and loading case.

Then, as ''W'' and Δ depend only on &lt;math&gt;L/H&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;W=\frac{\sigma V}{FL}=\frac{\rho V}{FL}\frac{\sigma}{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;

and:

: &lt;math&gt; W \frac \rho \sigma =\frac{\rho V}{FL} \div \{G_e\} \{M_a\}, &lt;/math&gt;

which for a given loading case, is the specific weight of a macrostructure per unit of force and length, depending only from the geometry through ''L/H'', and the materials though ''σ''/''ρ''.

''Wρ''/''σ'' includes thus, the material factor {''M&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''} (''ρ''/''σ'' and ''ρ''/''E'' for tension and compression without buckling, ''ρ''/''E''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; for compression limited by buckling, ''ρ''/''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2/3&lt;/sup&gt; and ''ρ''/''E''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; for pure bending, ''ρ''{{sqrt|3/''σ''}} and ''ρ''/''G'' for pure shear) and the form factor {''G&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''}.

All other factor being equal, a cluster of tubes with a diameter ''H'' and a wall thickness ''e'',  compared to a solid bar of equal volume in a material characterized by ''ρ'' , ''σ'' , ''E''  et ''G'' , presents an apparent density ''ρ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 4''k''(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'')''ρ'' with ''k'' = ''e''/''H'', allowable stress  ''σ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 4''k''(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'')''σ'',

The [[Young's modulus]] is &lt;math&gt;\ E_a=4k(1-k)E&lt;/math&gt; and the [[shear modulus]] is &lt;math&gt;\ G_a=4k(1-k)G&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus

: &lt;math&gt;\ \rho_a/E_a^{1/2}=2\sqrt{k-k^2}\rho/E^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt;\rho_a/\sigma_a^{2/3}=(4k-4k^2)^{1/3}\rho/\sigma^{2/3}&lt;/math&gt;

This explains the better performances of lighter materials for structural elements subject to compression or bending. 
 
This indicator allows to compare the efficiency of macrostructures including geometry and material.

It echos the work of M.F. Ashby: "Materials Selection in Mechanical Design" (1992).&lt;ref&gt;M.F. Ashby, ''Materials Selection in Mechanical Design'', 311 pages, 1997. Butterworth-Heinemann edition, division of Reed Educational and Professional Publishing Ltd. Oxford (first edition in 1992 by Pergamon Press Ltd), UK.&lt;/ref&gt; He analyses {''G&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''} and {''M&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''} separately as, for his studies, {''M&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''} relates to a large amount of the materials physical properties.

Different and complementary, it can also be placed alongside work carried out since 1969 by the Institut Für Leichte Flächentragwerke in Stuttgart under the direction of Frei Otto and now Werner SobekK, which refers to indices named ''Tra'' and ''Bic''.&lt;ref&gt;''Il Publikationen: Institut Für Leichte Flächentragwerke'', Universität Stuttgart, plaffenwaldring, 14, 70569 Stuttgart; (Current director: Prof. Dr. Ir. Werner Sobek). tel 00.49.711.685.35.99 – fax 00.49.711.685.37.89&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tra'' is defined as the product of the length of the trajectory of the force ''F&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'', (causing the collapse of the structure) onto the supports by the intensity of this force, and the ''Bic'' is the relationship of the mass of the structure with ''Tra''.

Since ''ρ*''  is the density of the material (in kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), and  ''α'' is, like ''W'', a constant depending on the type of structure and the loading case: 

: &lt;math&gt;Bic=\rho^* V/Tra \text{ and } Tra=F_rL/\alpha; &lt;/math&gt;

therefore, with stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma_r&lt;/math&gt; reached under &lt;math&gt;F_r&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;Bic=\alpha\frac{\rho^* V}{F_r L} = \alpha \frac{\rho^*} \sigma \frac{F}{F_r}W&lt;/math&gt;

and as

: &lt;math&gt;\ \frac F {F_r} = \frac \sigma {\sigma_r}\ :\ Bic=\frac{\rho^*}{\sigma_r}\alpha W. &lt;/math&gt;

Unlike ''W'' , which is dimensionless, ''Bic'' is expressed in ''kg/Nm''. Therefore, depending on the material, an independent comparison of different morphologies is not possible. 
It is surprising to note that despite the abundance of their works, none of them mention or make any effort to study ''W'' and its relationship with ''L/H''.

It appears that only V. Quintas Ripoll&lt;ref&gt;Valentin Quintas Ripoll, Pro. Titular Dep. Estructuras de Edificación E.T.S Arquitectura. Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, ''Sobre el teorema de Maxwell y la optimización de arcos de cubierta'',Informes de la construcción, Vol 40, n°400, marzo/abril 1989, pages 57 à 70, Madrid.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valentin Quintas Ripoll, ''Sobre las formas de minimo volumen de las celosías de sección constante'', Informes de la Construcción, Vol 43, n°418, marzo/abril 1992, pages 61 à 77, Madrid.&lt;/ref&gt; and W. Zalewski and St. Kus&lt;ref&gt;W. Zalewski, St. Kus, ''Shaping structures for least Weight'', proceedings of the I.A.S.S International Congress on Shells and Spatial Structures, Stuttgart, 1992, pages 376 à 383.&lt;/ref&gt; mentioned the volume indicator ''W'' without examining it in depth.

== Validity limits of ''W'' and Δ ==

* In general, the second order effects have very little influence on ''W'',  but they can have a significant impact on Δ. ''W'' and Δ therefore also depend on ''E/σ''.

* The shearing force ''T'' may be crucial in the case of short and continuous elements, subject to bending so that ''W'' does not fall below a given value, regardless of the reduction of the slenderness ''L/H''. However, this limitation is very theoretical because it is always possible to remove it by transferring material from the flanges to the web of the section, close to the supports.

* The stress ''σ'' to which the structure can be subjected depends on the nature, the internal geometry, the production method and the implementation of the materials, as well as several other factors, including the dimensional accuracy of the actual construction, the nature of the connections of the components or their fire resistance, but also the skill with which the geometry of the structure is designed to cope with elastic instability. Pierre Latteur,&lt;ref&gt;P. Latteur, ''Optimisation des treillis, arcs, poutres et câbles sur base d'indicateurs morphologiques – Application aux structures soumises en partie ou en totalité au flambement'', Tome I: Thesis, 328 p.; Tome II: Thesis appendix, 12 p.; Tome III: Appendix to chapter 2, 432 p. (May 2000). Ph.D. Thesis in Applied Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Brussel.&lt;/ref&gt; who discovered the buckling indicator, studied the influence of elastic instability on ''W'' and Δ.
In this regard, it is important to note that the existence of anchoring points of an element in traction may reduce the apparent permissible stress to the same level as the reduction necessary to take into account a moderate level of elastic instability. 
The influence on ''W'' of the buckling of the compressed parts on one side and of the anchoring points at the extremities of an element in traction on the other side is analysed on pages 30 to 58 in the « reference book ».

* The allowable stress ''σ'' is also often reduced by the need to limit the displacement ''δ'' of the structure since it is not possible to significantly alter ''E'' for a given material.

* Considerations regarding fatigue, ductility and dynamic forces also limit the working stress.

* It is not always straightforward to establish the nature and the overall maximum intensity of the forces ''F''(including dead weight) to which the structure is subject, which again has a direct influence on the working stress.

* The connections of an element in compression or in traction are considered as hinged. Any clamping, even partial ones, introduce parasitic forces which add extra weight to the structure.

* For certain types of the structures, the volume of the connections adds to the net volume defined by ''W''. Its importance depends on the nature of the material and the context in which it is used; this needs to be determined on a case-by-case basis. 
It follows that initially, only ''W'' and Δ should be taken into account for the morphological design of a structure, assuming that it is ultra-dampened (i.e. its internal damping is greater than the critical damping), which makes it impervious to dynamic stress. 
The volume ''V'' of a structure is therefore directly proportional to the total intensity of the force ''F'' which is applied to it, to its length ''L'' and to the morphological factor ''W''; it is inversely proportional to the stress ''σ'' to which it can be subjected. Furthermore, the weight of a structure is proportional to the density ''ρ'' of the material from which it is constructed. However, its maximum displacement ''δ'' remains proportional to the span ''L'' and the morphological factor Δ, as well as the ratio between its working stress ''σ'' and the modulus of elasticity ''E''.

If it is a case of limiting the weight (or the volume) and the deformation of a structure for a given stress ''F'' and span ''L'', with all other aspects remaining unchanged, then the work of the structural engineer involves minimising ''W'' and ''ρ/σ'' on one side and Δ and ''σ/E'' ont the other.

== Accuracy of ''W'' and Δ ==

=== Theoretical accuracy ===
For the large majority of compressed elements, it is possible to limit the reduction of the working stress to 25% by taking into account elastic instability, providing that the designer focuses on ensuring an efficient geometric design from as early as the initial sketches. This means that the increase in their volume indicator can also be limited to 25% . The volume of the elements subject to pure traction is also only very rarely limited to the product of the net distance over which a force is applied by a section strained at the permissible stress. In other words, their real volume indicator is thus also higher than the one which results from the calculation of ''W''.  A bar under traction can be welded at its extremities; no extra material apart from the negligible welding material is added, but the rigidity introduce parasitic moments which absorb some of the permissible stress.

The bar can be articulated at its extremities and work at its permissible stress, but this requires close end sockets or attachment mechanisms whose volume is far from negligible, especially if the bar is short or highly stressed. As L.H. Cox demonstrated,&lt;ref&gt;L.H. Cox, ''The design of structures of least weight'', 135 p., 1965, Pergamon Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt; in this case, it is worth taking into account ''n'' bars each with a cross-section of Ω/''n'', strained by force ''F/n'' with 2''n'' sockets, instead of one bar with a cross-section Ω strained by a force ''F'' with 2 sockets, since the total volume of 2''n'' sockets in the first case is much less than that of 2 sockets in the second.

The anchoring of the extremities of a bar under traction can also be ensured by adherence, as is usually the case for the rebars in elements made of reinforced concrete. In this specific case, it is necessary to have an anchoring length at least 30 times the diameter of the bar. The bar then has a length ''L''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;60''H'' for a useful length ''L''; its theoretical volume indicator ''W'' = 1 becomes ''W'' = 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;60''H''/''L''. Consequently, ''L''/''H'' must be greater than 240 (which is always theoretically possible) so that ''W'' does not increase by more than 25%. This observation also helps to show another reason for taking into account n bars with a crosssection Ω/''n'' instead of one bar with a cross-section&amp;nbsp;Ω.

Finally, connections consisting of bolts, dowels, pins or nails, especially in the case of wooden components, significantly reduce usable sections. For elements in traction, a reduction of 25% in the working stress or an increase of 25% in the volume is therefore also necessary in the majority of cases. Determining the volume and the displacement of a structure using the indicators ''W'' and Δ is therefore reliable theoretically, providing that:

* the working stress is reduced by at least 25% ;

* de dessiner les éléments comprimés et les assemblages avec discernement.

* great attention is paid to the design of compressed parts and connections. The overall proportions of an optimised structure, without taking buckling into account, are significantly altered when the compressed bars need to be shortened to take account of elastic instability. It becomes sensitive to the scale effect, leading to an extension of the overall proportion and increasing the weight of the structure. Inversely, a shortening of the overall proportions is necessary when the volume of the connections needs to be considered, since the influence of this volume reduces when the bars are lengthened. This shows the advantage of accurately designing not only the compressed parts, but also the connections, in order to avoid these flaws. One of Niki de Saint-Phalle’s light sculptures are therefore preferable to Giacometti’s slender but heavy structures !

=== Practical accuracy ===

The volume of the material of the structure, as determined using ''W'', can only be obtained accurately if the theoretical values of the relevant characteristic of the sections under strain ''σ'' can be measured in practice.
As shown in Figure 1 above, this characteristic is:

* ''Ω'' for an element under pure compression without buckling ;
* ''I'' for an element under pure compression with buckling (as well as for deformation under
pure bending) ;
* ''I''/''H'' for an element under simple bending.

It is always possible to obtain the precise value of these characteristics when the parts are made of moulded materials, such as reinforced concrete, or squared-off materials, such as wood or stone. However, this is not the case for laminated or extruded materials, produced on an industrial production line, such as steel or aluminium. It is important therefore to produce these elements with the smallest possible difference in size between two of them in order to avoid an unnecessary use of material. This use is consistent when the related deviation ''c'' between two successive values ''k&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; is constant, thus (''k''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) / ''k&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''c'' or ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = (''c''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) ''k&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = {{math|(''c''+1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} ''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

This is the principle of the geometric series known as the Renard Series (named after Colonel Renard who was the first to use them in calculating the diameter of cabling on aircraft) featured in the French standard NF X01-002.&lt;ref&gt;French National Association for Standardisation (Association Française de Normalisation/AFNOR), ''NFX 01-002  Guide pour le choix des séries de nombres normaux et des séries comportant des valeurs plus arrondies de nombres normaux'', 6 pages, December 1967, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; When all the necessary values are only very slightly greater than a series value, ''c'' represents the maximum increase and ''c''/2 the average increase of ''W''. Being universally used, the case of the steel profiles requires an in-depth examination (see the “reference book”; page 26 to 29). Consequently, the use of industrial steel profiles automatically leads to a significant increase of ''W'':

* by half of the theoretical inaccuracy for pure compression ;
* practically identical for bending or compression subject to buckling.

This situation is magnified when the number of profiles available is restricted, which may explain the use of forms which are not theoretically optimal but which tend to subject the available profiles to the permissible stress ''σ'' (such as, for example, pylons for high-voltage electric lines or variable height truss bridges). For structures subject to pure bending, this also explains the use of flat plates of variable lengths added to the flanges of these ''I'' profiles to obtain the inertia or resisting moment required, with the greatest degree of accuracy. Conversely, the significant variety in the tubes available enables a relative deviation value ''c'' which is both smaller and more constant. They also cover a much wider range in both the lower and higher characteristic values. Since their geometric performance is practically identical to that of the I profiles, tubes are the most appropriate industrial solution in order to practically eliminate any increase in the volume indicator ''W''. Nevertheless, practical issues of availability and corrosion may limit their use.

[[File:Hyperbolic-triangle-interior-angles.svg|thumb|A hyperbolic triangle – its interior angles do not sum to 180 degrees.]]

A '''Coxeter decomposition''' of a [[polygon]] is a decomposition into a finite number of polygons in which any two sharing a side are reflections of each other along that side. Hyperbolic polygons are the analogues of Euclidean polygons in [[hyperbolic geometry]]. A hyperbolic ''n''-gon is an area bounded by ''n'' segments, rays, or entire straight lines. The standard model for this geometry is the [[Poincaré disk model]]. A major difference between Euclidean and hyperbolic polygons is that the sum of internal angles of a hyperbolic polygon is not the same as Euclidean polygons. In particular, the sum of the angles of a [[hyperbolic triangle]] is less than 180 degrees. [[File:TriangleGroup.pdf|thumb|A triangle group formed by reflecting a triangle on its sides.]]Coxeter decompositions are named after [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter]], an accomplished 20th century geometer. He introduced the [[Coxeter group]], an abstract group  generated by reflections. These groups have many uses, including producing the rotations of [[Platonic solid]]s and tessellating the plane.

== Coxeter decompositions ==
Given a polygon ''P'', a group ''G'' can be generated by reflecting ''P'' around its sides. If the angles of ''P'' are {{pi}}/''k'' for natural numbers ''k'', then ''G'' will be discrete. A '''Coxeter decomposition''' of a [[polygon]] is a decomposition into a finite number of polygons in which any two sharing a side are reflections of each other along that side.

The goal of a Coxeter decomposition is to break up a polygon into a composition of congruent triangles reflected on its sides.

== Hyperbolic triangles ==
If triangle ABC can undergo Coxeter decomposition and has angles &lt;math&gt;k_i\frac{\pi}{q_i}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; is the number of times the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th angle is broken up, the triangle ABC can be written as &lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{k_1}{q_1}, \frac{k_2}{q_2}, \frac{k_3}{q_3}\right)&lt;/math&gt;. Several properties of these fundamental polygons are known for hyperbolic triangles.
[[File:Coxeterdecompositiontriangle.png|thumb|The decomposition of a triangle with three fundamental angles]]
* The fundamental triangle has a right angle. The proof of this involves two cases dependent on if the angles of the decomposed triangle are fundamental. If they are not, then it follows that since the process of decomposition is finite, eventually a fundamental triangle will be formed with a right angle. If they are, a proof by contradiction based on the area of the fundamental triangle proves that it will have a right angle.
* For a triangle &lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{k_1}{q_1}, \frac{k_2}{q_2}, \frac{k_3}{q_3}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, at least two &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; are equal. This is also proved by contradiction based on the area of the fundamental polygon found using the [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]]. We can say the area of the whole triangle is equal to the number of fundamental triangles times their area. This gives us  &lt;math&gt;1 -\sum_{i=1}^3 \frac{k_i}{q_i} = N \left( 1 -\sum_{i=1}^3 \frac 1 {q_i}\right)&lt;/math&gt;. If we assume that &lt;math&gt;q_1&gt;q_2&gt;q_3&lt;/math&gt;, then the previous equality is broken for &lt;math&gt;N&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore, at least two angles are equal.
* Given a triangle where all three angles are fundamental, there is a single decomposition. A nontrivial proof of this can be found in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Coxeter Decompositions of Hyperbolic Polygons |journal=[[European J. Combin.]] |volume=19 |issue=7 |pages=801–817 |author=Felikson, A. A. |date=1998 |doi=10.1006/eujc.1998.0238}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* All possible decompositions are known.[[File:Coxeter all possible triangles decompositions.png|thumb|These are all Coxeter decompositions of hyperbolic triangles, excluding the more detailed one above.]]

== Other hyperbolic polygons ==
Quadrilaterals may also have Coxeter decompositions.
* If a quadrilateral in not convex, then there are two possible triangular decompositions. This is done by decomposing it into two triangles are then decomposing those. These two triangles are obtuse. 
*A quadrilateral can be decomposed by quadrilaterals.
* All decompositions of convex quadrilaterals are also known. Showing them all is impractical in this article, but some are pictured here.

      <comment>Adding [[Wikipedia:Short description|short description]]: "Relate the direct image and the pull-back of sheaves" ([[Wikipedia:Shortdesc helper|Shortdesc helper]])</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text bytes="25861" xml:space="preserve">{{short description|Relate the direct image and the pull-back of sheaves}}
In mathematics, the '''base change theorems''' relate the [[Direct image functor|direct image]] and the [[Pullback (category theory)|pull-back]] of [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]]. More precisely, they are about the base change map, given by the following [[natural transformation]] of sheaves:

:&lt;math&gt;g^*(R^r f_* \mathcal{F}) \to R^r f'_*(g'^*\mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rcl} X' &amp; \stackrel{g'}\to &amp; X \\
f' \downarrow &amp; &amp; \downarrow f \\
S' &amp; \stackrel g \to &amp; S \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

is a [[Cartesian square (category theory)|Cartesian square]] of topological spaces and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a sheaf on ''X''.

Such theorems exist in different branches of geometry: for (essentially arbitrary) topological spaces and proper maps ''f'', in [[algebraic geometry]] for (quasi-)coherent sheaves and ''f'' proper or ''g'' flat, similarly in [[analytic geometry]], but also for [[étale sheaf|étale sheaves]] for ''f'' proper or ''g'' smooth.

== Introduction ==
A simple base change phenomenon arises in [[commutative algebra]] when ''A'' is a [[commutative ring]] and ''B'' and ''A' ''are two ''A''-algebras. Let &lt;math&gt;B' = B \otimes_A A'&lt;/math&gt;. In this situation, given a ''B''-module ''M'', there is an isomorphism (of ''A' ''-modules):

:&lt;math&gt;(M \otimes_B B')_{A'} \cong (M_A) \otimes_A A'.&lt;/math&gt;

Here the subscript indicates the forgetful functor, i.e., &lt;math&gt;M_A&lt;/math&gt; is ''M'', but regarded as an ''A''-module.
Indeed, such an isomorphism is obtained by observing 

:&lt;math&gt;M \otimes_B B' = M \otimes_B B \otimes_A A' \cong M \otimes_A A'.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the two operations, namely forgetful functors and tensor products commute in the sense of the above isomorphism.
The base change theorems discussed below are statements of a similar kind.

== Definition of the base change map ==
{{Images of sheaves}}
The base change theorems presented below all assert that (for different types of sheaves, and under various assumptions on the maps involved), that the following ''base change map''

:&lt;math&gt;g^*(R^r f_* \mathcal{F}) \to R^r f'_*(g'^*\mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt;

is an isomorphism, where

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rcl} X' &amp; \stackrel{g'}\to &amp; X \\
f' \downarrow &amp; &amp; \downarrow f \\
S' &amp; \stackrel g \to &amp; S\\ \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

are continuous maps between topological spaces that form a [[Cartesian square (category theory)|Cartesian square]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a sheaf on ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;
The roles of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; are symmetric, and in some contexts (especially smooth base change) the more familiar formulation is the other one (dealing instead with the map &lt;math&gt;f^* R^i g_* \mathcal G \rightarrow R^i g'_* f'^* \mathcal G&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal G&lt;/math&gt; a sheaf on &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt;). For consistency, the results in this article below are all stated for the '''same''' situation, namely the map &lt;math&gt;g^* R^i f_* \mathcal F \rightarrow R^i f'_* g'^* \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt;; but readers should be sure to check this against their expectations.&lt;/ref&gt; Here &lt;math&gt;R^i f_* \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[higher direct image]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; under ''f'', i.e., the [[derived functor]] of the direct image (also known as pushforward) functor &lt;math&gt;f_*&lt;/math&gt;.

This map exists without any assumptions on the maps ''f'' and ''g''. It is constructed as follows: since &lt;math&gt;g'^*&lt;/math&gt; is [[adjoint functor|left adjoint]] to &lt;math&gt;g'_*&lt;/math&gt;, there is a natural map (called unit map)
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{id} \to g'_* \circ g'^*&lt;/math&gt;
and so 

:&lt;math&gt;R^r f_* \to R^r f_* \circ g'_* \circ g'^*.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Grothendieck spectral sequence]] then gives the first map and the last map (they are edge maps) in:

:&lt;math&gt;R^r f_* \circ g'_* \circ g'^* \to R^r(f \circ g')_* \circ g'^* = R^r(g \circ f')_* \circ g'^* \to g_* \circ R^r f'_* \circ g'^*.&lt;/math&gt;

Combining this with the above yields

:&lt;math&gt;R^r f_* \to g_* \circ R^r f'_* \circ g'^*.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the adjointness of &lt;math&gt;g^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_*&lt;/math&gt; finally yields the desired map.

The above-mentioned introductory example is a special case of this, namely for the affine schemes &lt;math&gt;X = \operatorname{Spec} (B), S = \operatorname{Spec} (A), S' = \operatorname{Spec} (A')&lt;/math&gt; and, consequently, &lt;math&gt;X' = \operatorname{Spec} (B')&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[quasi-coherent sheaf]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F := \tilde M&lt;/math&gt; associated to the ''B''-module ''M''.

It is conceptually convenient to organize the above base change maps, which only involve only a single higher direct image functor, into one which encodes all &lt;math&gt;R^r f_*&lt;/math&gt; at a time. In fact, similar arguments as above yield a map in the [[derived category]] of sheaves on ''S':''

:&lt;math&gt;g^* Rf_* (\mathcal{F}) \to Rf'_*(g'^*\mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Rf_*&lt;/math&gt; denotes the (total) derived functor of &lt;math&gt;f_*&lt;/math&gt;.

== General topology ==
===Proper base change===
If ''X'' is a [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological space]], ''S'' is a [[locally compact space|locally compact]] Hausdorff space and ''f'' is universally closed (i.e., &lt;math&gt;X \times_S T \to T&lt;/math&gt; is a [[closed map]] for any continuous map &lt;math&gt;T \to S&lt;/math&gt;), then
the base change map

:&lt;math&gt;g^* R^r f_* \mathcal F \to R^r f'_* g'^* \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt;

is an isomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Milne|2012|loc=Theorem 17.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, we have: for &lt;math&gt;s \in S&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;(R^r f_* \mathcal{F})_s = \varinjlim H^r(U, \mathcal{F}) = H^r(X_s, \mathcal{F}), \quad X_s = f^{-1}(s)&lt;/math&gt;

and so for &lt;math&gt;s = g(t)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;g^* (R^r f_* \mathcal{F})_t = H^r(X_s, \mathcal{F}) = H^r(X'_t, g'^* \mathcal{F}) = R^r f'_* (g'^* \mathcal{F})_t.&lt;/math&gt;

To encode all individual higher derived functors of &lt;math&gt;f_*&lt;/math&gt; into one entity, the above statement may equivalently be rephrased by saying that the base change map

:&lt;math&gt;g^* Rf_* \mathcal F \to Rf'_* g'^* \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt;

is a [[quasi-isomorphism]].

The assumptions that the involved spaces be Hausdorff have been weakened by {{harvtxt|Schnürer|Soergel|2016}}.

{{harvtxt|Lurie|2009}} has extended the above theorem to [[non-abelian cohomology|non-abelian sheaf cohomology]], i.e., sheaves taking values in [[simplicial set]]s (as opposed to abelian groups).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lurie|2009|loc=Theorem 7.3.1.16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct image with compact support===
If the map ''f'' is not closed, the base change map need not be an isomorphism, as the following example shows (the maps are the standard inclusions) :

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rcl}
\emptyset &amp; \stackrel {g'} \to &amp; \mathbb C \setminus \{0\} \\
f' \downarrow &amp; &amp; \downarrow f \\
\{0\} &amp; \stackrel g \to &amp; \mathbb C
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

One the one hand &lt;math&gt;f'_* g'^* \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; is always zero, but if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; is a [[local system]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb C \setminus \{0\}&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to a [[Group representation|representation]] of the [[fundamental group]] &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(X)&lt;/math&gt; (which is isomorphic to '''Z'''), then &lt;math&gt;g^* f_* \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; can be computed as the [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]]s of the [[monodromy]] action of &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(X, x)&lt;/math&gt; on the [[stalk (sheaf)|stalk]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F_x&lt;/math&gt; (for any &lt;math&gt;x \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;), which need not vanish.

To obtain a base-change result, the functor &lt;math&gt;f_*&lt;/math&gt; (or its derived functor) has to be replaced by the [[direct image with compact support]] &lt;math&gt;Rf_!&lt;/math&gt;. For example, if &lt;math&gt;f: X \to S&lt;/math&gt; is the inclusion of an open subset, such as in the above example, &lt;math&gt;Rf_! \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; is the extension by zero, i.e., its stalks are given by

:&lt;math&gt;(Rf_! \mathcal F)_s = \begin{cases} \mathcal F_s &amp; s \in X, \\ 0 &amp; s \notin X. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

In general, there is a map &lt;math&gt;Rf_! \mathcal F \to Rf_* \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt;, which is a quasi-isomorphism if ''f'' is proper, but not in general. The proper base change theorem mentioned above has the following generalization: there is a quasi-isomorphism&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Iversen|1986}}, the four spaces are assumed to be [[locally compact]] and of finite dimension.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;g^* Rf_! \mathcal F \to Rf'_! g'^* \mathcal F.&lt;/math&gt;

==Base change for quasi-coherent sheaves==

===Proper base change===
''Proper base change theorems'' for [[quasi-coherent sheaf|quasi-coherent sheaves]] apply in the following situation: &lt;math&gt;f: X \to S&lt;/math&gt; is a [[proper morphism]] between [[noetherian scheme]]s, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[coherent sheaf]] which is [[flat morphism|flat]] over ''S'' (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F_x&lt;/math&gt; is [[flat module|flat]] over &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O_{S, f(x)}&lt;/math&gt;). In this situation, the following statements hold:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Grothendieck|1963|loc=Section 7.7}}, {{harvtxt|Hartshorne|1977|loc=Theorem III.12.11}}, {{harvtxt|Vakil|2015|loc=Chapter 28 ''Cohomology and base change theorems''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Semicontinuity theorem":
** For each &lt;math&gt;p \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;, the function &lt;math&gt;s \mapsto \dim_{k(s)} H^p (X_s, \mathcal{F}_s): S \to \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is upper [[semicontinuous]].
** The function &lt;math&gt;s \mapsto \chi(\mathcal{F}_s)&lt;/math&gt; is locally constant, where &lt;math&gt;\chi(\mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Euler characteristic]].
*  "[[Hans Grauert|Grauert]]'s theorem": if ''S'' is reduced and connected, then for each &lt;math&gt;p \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; the following are equivalent
**&lt;math&gt;s \mapsto \dim_{k(s)} H^p (X_s, \mathcal{F}_s)&lt;/math&gt; is constant.
** &lt;math&gt;R^p f_* \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is locally free and the natural map
::&lt;math&gt;R^p f_* \mathcal{F} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_S} k(s) \to H^p(X_s, \mathcal{F}_s)&lt;/math&gt;
:is an isomorphism for all &lt;math&gt;s \in S&lt;/math&gt;.
:Furthermore, if these conditions hold, then the natural map
::&lt;math&gt;R^{p-1} f_* \mathcal{F} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_S} k(s) \to H^{p-1}(X_s, \mathcal{F}_s)&lt;/math&gt;
:is an isomorphism for all &lt;math&gt;s \in S&lt;/math&gt;.
* If, for some ''p'', &lt;math&gt;H^p(X_s, \mathcal{F}_s) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;s \in S&lt;/math&gt;, then the natural map
::&lt;math&gt;R^{p-1} f_* \mathcal{F} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_S} k(s) \to H^{p-1}(X_s, \mathcal{F}_s)&lt;/math&gt;
:is an isomorphism for all &lt;math&gt;s \in S&lt;/math&gt;.

As the [[stalk (mathematics)|stalk]] of the sheaf &lt;math&gt;R^p f_* \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; is closely related to the cohomology of the fiber of the point under ''f'', this statement is paraphrased by saying that "cohomology commutes with base extension".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt | Hartshorne | 1977 | p=255 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These statements are proved using the following fact, where in addition to the above assumptions &lt;math&gt;S = \operatorname{Spec} A&lt;/math&gt;: there is a finite complex &lt;math&gt;0 \to K^0 \to K^1 \to \cdots \to K^n \to 0&lt;/math&gt; of [[finitely generated projective module|finitely generated projective ''A''-modules]] and a natural isomorphism of functors
:&lt;math&gt;H^p(X \times_S \operatorname{Spec} -, \mathcal{F} \otimes_A -) \to H^p(K^\bullet \otimes_A -), p \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;
on the category of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;-algebras.

===Flat base change===
The base change map
:&lt;math&gt;g^*(R^r f_* \mathcal{F}) \to R^r f'_*(g'^*\mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt;
is an isomorphism for a [[quasi-coherent sheaf]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; (on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;), provided that the map &lt;math&gt;g: S' \rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt; is ''[[flat morphism|flat]]'' (together with a number of technical conditions: ''f'' needs to be a [[separated morphism|separated]] [[morphism of finite type]], the schemes involved need to be Noetherian).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hartshorne|1977|loc=Proposition III.9.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Flat base change in the derived category====
A far reaching extension of flat base change is possible when considering the base change map
:&lt;math&gt;Lg^* Rf_* (\mathcal{F}) \to Rf'_*(Lg'^*\mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt;
in the derived category of sheaves on ''S','' similarly as mentioned above. Here &lt;math&gt;Lg^*&lt;/math&gt; is the (total) derived functor of the pullback of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O&lt;/math&gt;-modules (because &lt;math&gt;g^* \mathcal G = \mathcal O_X \otimes_{g^{-1} \mathcal O_S} g^{-1} \mathcal G&lt;/math&gt; involves a tensor product, &lt;math&gt;g^*&lt;/math&gt; is not exact when {{math|''g''}} is not flat and therefore is not equal to its derived functor &lt;math&gt;Lg^*&lt;/math&gt;).
This map is a quasi-isomorphism provided that the following conditions are satisfied:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Berthelot|Grothendieck|Illusie|1971|loc=SGA 6 IV, Proposition 3.1.0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is quasi-compact and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is quasi-compact and quasi-separated,
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; is an object in &lt;math&gt;D^b(\mathcal{O}_X\text{-mod})&lt;/math&gt;, the bounded derived category of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X&lt;/math&gt;-modules, and its cohomology sheaves are quasi-coherent (for example, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; could be a bounded complex of quasi-coherent sheaves)
* &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; are ''Tor-independent'' over &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that if &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s' \in S'&lt;/math&gt; satisfy &lt;math&gt;f(x) = s = g(s')&lt;/math&gt;, then for all integers &lt;math&gt;p \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tor}_p^{\mathcal{O}_{S,s}}(\mathcal{O}_{X,x}, \mathcal{O}_{S',s'}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
* One of the following conditions is satisfied:
** &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; has finite flat amplitude relative to &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that it is quasi-isomorphic in &lt;math&gt;D^-(f^{-1}\mathcal O_S\text{-mod})&lt;/math&gt; to a complex &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal F')^i&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\mathcal O_S&lt;/math&gt;-flat for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; outside some bounded interval &lt;math&gt;[m, n]&lt;/math&gt;; equivalently, there exists an interval &lt;math&gt;[m, n]&lt;/math&gt; such that for any complex &lt;math&gt;\mathcal G&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;D^-(f^{-1}\mathcal O_S\text{-mod})&lt;/math&gt;, one has &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tor}_i(\mathcal F, \mathcal G) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; outside &lt;math&gt;[m, n]&lt;/math&gt;; or
** &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; has finite Tor-dimension, meaning that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_{S'}&lt;/math&gt; has finite flat amplitude relative to &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.

One advantage of this formulation is that the flatness hypothesis has been weakened.  However, making concrete computations of the cohomology of the left- and right-hand sides now requires the [[Grothendieck spectral sequence]].

===Base change in derived algebraic geometry===
[[Derived algebraic geometry]] provides a means to drop the flatness assumption, provided that the pullback &lt;math&gt;X'&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by the [[homotopy pullback]]. In the easiest case when ''X'', ''S'', and &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; are affine (with the notation as above), the homotopy pullback is given by the [[derived functor|derived]] tensor product
:&lt;math&gt;X' = \operatorname{Spec} (B' \otimes^L_B A)&lt;/math&gt;
Then, assuming that the schemes (or, more generally, derived schemes) involved are quasi-compact and quasi-separated, the natural transformation
:&lt;math&gt;L g^* R f_* \mathcal{F} \to Rf'_* Lg'^* \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;
is a [[quasi-isomorphism]] for any quasi-coherent sheaf, or more generally a [[chain complex|complex]] of quasi-coherent sheaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Toën|2012|loc=Proposition 1.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The afore-mentioned flat base change result is in fact a special case since for ''g'' flat the homotopy pullback (which is locally given by a derived tensor product) agrees with the ordinary pullback (locally given by the underived tensor product), and since the pullback along the flat maps ''g'' and ''g' ''are automatically derived (i.e., &lt;math&gt;Lg^* = g^*&lt;/math&gt;). The auxiliary assumptions related to the Tor-independence or Tor-amplitude in the preceding base change theorem also become unnecessary.

In the above form, base change has been extended by {{harvtxt|Ben-Zvi|Francis|Nadler|2010}} to the situation where ''X'', ''S'', and ''S' ''are (possibly derived) [[stack (mathematics)|stack]]s, provided that the map ''f'' is a perfect map (which includes the case that ''f'' is a quasi-compact, quasi-separated map of schemes, but also includes more general stacks, such as the [[classifying stack]] ''BG'' of an [[algebraic group]] in characteristic zero).

===Variants and applications===
Proper base change also holds in the context of [[complex manifolds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Grauert|1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[theorem on formal functions]] is a variant of the proper base change, where the pullback is replaced by a [[completion (metric space)|completion]] operation.

The [[see-saw principle]] and the [[theorem of the cube]], which are foundational facts in the theory of [[abelian varieties]], are a consequence of proper base change.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mumford|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A base-change also holds for [[D-modules]]: if ''X'', ''S'', ''X','' and ''S' ''are smooth varieties (but ''f'' and ''g'' need not be flat or proper etc.), there is a quasi-isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;g^\dagger \int_f \mathcal F \to \int_{f'} g'^\dagger \mathcal F,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;-^\dagger&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\int&lt;/math&gt; denote the inverse and direct image functors for ''D''-modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hotta|Takeuchi|Tanisaki|2008|loc=Theorem 1.7.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Base change for étale sheaves==
For [[étale sheaf|étale torsion sheaves]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt;, there are two base change results referred to as ''proper'' and ''smooth base change'', respectively: base change holds if &lt;math&gt;f: X \rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt; is [[proper morphism|proper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Artin|Grothendieck|Verdier|1972|loc=Exposé XII}}, {{harvtxt|Milne|1980|loc=section VI.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also holds if ''g'' is [[smooth morphism|smooth]], provided that ''f'' is quasi-compact and provided that the torsion of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; is prime to the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of the [[residue field]]s of ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Artin|Grothendieck|Verdier|1972|loc=Exposé XVI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Closely related to proper base change is the following fact (the two theorems are usually proved simultaneously): let ''X'' be a variety over a [[separably closed field]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; a [[constructible sheaf]] on &lt;math&gt;X_\text{et}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;H^r(X, \mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt; are finite in each of the following cases:
*''X'' is complete, or 
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; has no ''p''-torsion, where ''p'' is the characteristic of ''k''.

Under additional assumptions, {{harvtxt|Deninger|1988}} extended the proper base change theorem to non-torsion étale sheaves.

===Applications===
In close analogy to the topological situation mentioned above, the base change map for an [[open immersion]] ''f'', 
:&lt;math&gt;g^* f_* \mathcal F \to f'_* g'^* \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt;
is not usually an isomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Milne|2012|loc=Example 8.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead the [[extension by zero]] functor &lt;math&gt;f_!&lt;/math&gt; satisfies an isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;g^* f_! \mathcal F \to f'_! g^* \mathcal F.&lt;/math&gt;
This fact and the proper base change suggest to define the ''direct image functor with compact support'' for a map ''f'' by
:&lt;math&gt;Rf_! := Rp_* j_!&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;f = p \circ j&lt;/math&gt; is a ''compactification'' of ''f'', i.e., a factorization into an open immersion followed by a proper map.
The proper base change theorem is needed to show that this is well-defined, i.e., independent (up to isomorphism) of the choice of the compactification.
Moreover, again in analogy to the case of sheaves on a topological space, a base change formula for &lt;math&gt;g_*&lt;/math&gt; vs. &lt;math&gt;Rf_!&lt;/math&gt; does hold for non-proper maps ''f''.

For the structural map &lt;math&gt;f: X \to S = \operatorname{Spec} k&lt;/math&gt; of a scheme over a field ''k'', the individual cohomologies of &lt;math&gt;Rf_! (\mathcal F)&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;H^*_c(X, \mathcal F)&lt;/math&gt; referred to as [[cohomology with compact support]]. It is an important variant of usual [[étale cohomology]].

Similar ideas are also used to construct an analogue of the functor &lt;math&gt;Rf_!&lt;/math&gt; in [[A1 homotopy theory|'''A'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-homotopy theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Ayoub|first=Joseph|title=Les six opérations de Grothendieck et le formalisme des cycles évanescents dans le monde motivique.

{{Main|Computational anatomy}}

'''Computational anatomy (CA)''' is a discipline within [[medical imaging]]  focusing on the study of anatomical shape and form at the visible or [[Gross anatomy|gross anatomical]] scale of [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]. 
The field is broadly defined and includes foundations in [[anatomy]], [[applied mathematics]] and [[pure mathematics]], including [[medical imaging]], [[neuroscience]], [[physics]], [[probability]], and [[statistics]]. It focuses on the anatomical structures being imaged, rather than the medical imaging devices. 
The central focus of the sub-field of [[computational anatomy]] within [[medical imaging]] is mapping information across anatomical coordinate systems most often dense information measured within a [[magnetic resonance imaging|magnetic resonance image]] (MRI). The introduction of flows into CA, which are akin to the equations of motion used in fluid dynamics, exploit the notion that dense coordinates in image analysis follow the [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Lagrangian and Eulerian]] equations of motion. In models based on Lagrangian and Eulerian flows of diffeomorphisms, the constraint is associated to topological properties, such as open sets being preserved, coordinates not crossing implying uniqueness and existence of the inverse mapping, and connected sets remaining connected.  The use of diffeomorphic methods grew quickly to dominate the field of mapping methods post Christensen's&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== The main statistical model==

[[File:Source-channel-model-Shannon.png|thumb|Source-channel model showing the source of images the deformable template &lt;math&gt;I \doteq \varphi \cdot I_\mathrm{temp} \in \mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; and channel output associated with MRI sensor &lt;math&gt;I^D \in \mathcal{I}^{\mathcal{D}}&lt;/math&gt;]]
The central statistical model of Computational Anatomy in the context of [[medical imaging]] has been the source-channel model of [[Shannon theory]]; the source is the deformable template of images &lt;math&gt; I \in \mathcal {I} &lt;/math&gt;, the channel outputs are the imaging sensors with observables &lt;math&gt; I^D \in {\mathcal I}^{\mathcal D} &lt;/math&gt; (see Figure). The importance of the source-channel model is that the variation in the anatomical configuration are modelled separated from the sensor variations of the Medical imagery. The [[Bayes' theorem|Bayes theory]] dictates that the model is characterized by the prior on the source, &lt;math&gt; \pi_{\mathcal{I}} (\cdot) &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;I \in \mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt;, and the conditional density on the observable

: &lt;math&gt; p(\cdot \mid I) \text{ on } I^D \in {\mathcal I}^{\mathcal D} &lt;/math&gt;

conditioned on &lt;math&gt; I \in \mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt;.

In deformable template theory, the images are linked to the templates, with the deformations a group which acts on the template;
see [[Group actions in computational anatomy|group action in computational anatomy]]
For image action &lt;math&gt;I(g) \doteq g \cdot I_\mathrm{temp}, g \in \mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt;,  then the prior on the group &lt;math&gt;\pi_{\mathcal{G}} (\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; induces the prior on images &lt;math&gt;\pi_{\mathcal{I}} (\cdot)&lt;/math&gt;, written as densities the log-posterior takes the form

:&lt;math&gt;
\log p(I(g)\mid I^D) \simeq \log p(I^D \mid I(g))+ \log \pi_{\mathcal{G}}(g).
&lt;/math&gt;

The random orbit model which follows specifies how to generate the group elements and therefore the random spray of objects which form the prior distribution.

For the study of deformable shape in CA, the high-dimensional diffeomorphism groups used in computational anatomy are generated via smooth flows &lt;math&gt; \varphi_t,  t \in [0,1] &lt;/math&gt; which satisfy the Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow fields satisfying the ordinary differential equation: [[File:Lagrangian flow.png|thumb|Showing the Lagrangian flow of coordinates &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; with associated vector fields &lt;math&gt;v_t, t \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; satisfying ordinary differential equation &lt;math&gt;\dot \varphi_t = v_t(\varphi_t), \varphi_0=id&lt;/math&gt;.]]

The vector fields are functions in a function space, modelled as a smooth [[Hilbert space|Hilbert]] space with the vector fields having 1-continuous derivative . For &lt;math&gt;v_t = \dot \varphi_t \circ \varphi_t^{-1}, t \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, the inverse of the flow is given by

The integral is calculated by integration by parts when &lt;math&gt;Av&lt;/math&gt; is a generalized function  in the dual space &lt;math&gt; V^*&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Riemannian exponential ===

{{Further|Riemannian metric and Lie-bracket in computational anatomy}}
In the [[Computational anatomy|random orbit model of computational anatomy]], the entire flow is reduced to the initial condition which forms the coordinates encoding the diffeomorphism. From the initial condition &lt;math&gt; v_0 &lt;/math&gt; then geodesic positioning  with respect to the [[Computational anatomy#Diffeomorphometry and the metric space of shapes and forms|Riemannian metric]] of Computational anatomy solves for the flow of the Euler-Lagrange equation.
Solving the geodesic from the initial condition &lt;math&gt; v_0 &lt;/math&gt; is termed the '''Riemannian-exponential,''' a mapping &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(\cdot): V \to \operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt; at identity to the group.

The Riemannian exponential satisfies &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Exp}_\mathrm{id} (v_0)= \varphi_1 &lt;/math&gt; for initial condition &lt;math&gt;\dot \varphi_0 = v_0&lt;/math&gt;, vector field dynamics &lt;math&gt;\dot \varphi_t = v_t \circ \varphi_t, t \in [0,1]
&lt;/math&gt;,
* for classical equation diffeomorphic shape momentum &lt;math&gt;  \int_X Av_t \cdot w \, dx &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Av \in V&lt;/math&gt;, then

:: &lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt} Av_t +  (Dv_t)^T Av_t +(DAv_t)v_t + ( \nabla \cdot v) Av_t =0  \ ;
&lt;/math&gt;
* for generalized equation, then &lt;math&gt;
Av \in V^* &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; w \in V &lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; \int_X \frac{d}{dt} Av_t \cdot w \,dx + \int_X Av_t \cdot ((Dv_t)w-(Dw)v_t)\,dx =0 . &lt;/math&gt;
It is extended to the entire group, &lt;math&gt;

I \doteq \varphi \cdot I_a &lt;/math&gt;, where the diffeomorphic change in coordinates is generated randomly via the geodesic flows.

==MAP estimation in the multiple-atlas orbit model==
The random orbit model induces the prior on shapes and images &lt;math&gt;I \in \mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; conditioned on a particular atlas &lt;math&gt; I_a \in \mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;. For this the generative model generates the mean field &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt; as a random change in coordinates of the template according to &lt;math&gt;I \doteq \varphi \cdot I_a 
&lt;/math&gt;, where the diffeomorphic change in coordinates is generated randomly via the geodesic flows. The prior on random transformations &lt;math&gt;\pi_\mathrm{Diff} (d\varphi) &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Diff}_V&lt;/math&gt; is induced by the flow &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v)&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;
v \in V &lt;/math&gt; constructed as a Gaussian random field prior &lt;math&gt; \pi_V(dv) &lt;/math&gt;. The density on the random observables at the output of the sensor &lt;math&gt;I^D \in \mathcal{I}^D&lt;/math&gt; are given by

: &lt;math&gt;
p(I^D\mid I_a) = \int_V p(I^D \mid \operatorname{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v) \cdot I_a ) \pi_V (dv) \ .
&lt;/math&gt;

[[Maximum a posteriori estimation]] (MAP) estimation is central to modern [[statistical theory]]. Parameters of interest &lt;math&gt; \theta \in \Theta &lt;/math&gt; take many forms including (i) disease type such as [[neurodegenerative]] or [[neurodevelopmental]] diseases,  (ii) structure type such as cortical or subcortical structures in problems associated to segmentation of images, and (iii) template reconstruction from populations.  Given the observed image &lt;math&gt; I^D  &lt;/math&gt;, MAP estimation maximizes the posterior:

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat \theta \doteq \arg \max_{\theta \in \Theta} \log p(\theta \mid I^D). &lt;/math&gt;

This requires computation of the conditional probabilities &lt;math&gt;p(\theta\mid I^D) = \frac{p(I^D,\theta)}{p(I^D)}&lt;/math&gt;.  The multiple atlas orbit model randomizes over the denumerable set of atlases &lt;math&gt;\{ I_a, a \in \mathcal{A} \}&lt;/math&gt;. The model on images in the orbit take the form of a multi-modal mixture distribution

:&lt;math&gt;p(I^D, \theta) = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}}  p(I^D,\theta\mid  I_a) \pi_{\mathcal A}(a) \ .&lt;/math&gt;

The conditional Gaussian model has been examined heavily for inexact matching in dense images and for landmark matching.

For uniform variance the endpoint error terms plays the role of the log-conditional (only a function of the mean field) giving the endpoint term:
{{NumBlk|:|
:&lt;math&gt;
-\log p(I^D \mid  I(g)) \simeq E(\varphi_1) \doteq  \frac{1}{2 \sigma^2} \| I^D - I \circ \varphi_1^{-1} \|^2.
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Landmark matching ===
Model &lt;math&gt;Y = \{ y_1,y_2,\dots \}&lt;/math&gt; as conditionally Gaussian with mean field &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1 (x_i), i=1,2,\dots, \varphi_1 \in \operatorname{Diff}_V&lt;/math&gt;, constant noise variance independent of landmarks. The log-conditional (only a function of the mean field) can be viewed as the endpoint term:
:&lt;math&gt; -\log p(I^D \mid I(g))\simeq \operatorname{E}(\varphi_1) \doteq  \frac{1}{2 \sigma^2}\sum_i \| y_i -\varphi_1(x_i) \|^2. &lt;/math&gt;

==MAP segmentation based on multiple atlases==
The random orbit model for multiple atlases models the orbit of shapes as the union over multiple anatomical orbits generated from the group action of diffeomorphisms, &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{I} = \textstyle  \bigcup_{a \in \mathcal{A}}\displaystyle \operatorname{Diff}_V \cdot I_a &lt;/math&gt;, with each atlas having a template and predefined segmentation field &lt;math&gt; (I_a,W_a),a = a_1,a_2,\ldots &lt;/math&gt;. incorporating the parcellation into anatomical structures of the coordinate of the MRI.. The pairs are indexed over the voxel lattice &lt;math&gt;I_a(x_i),W_a(x_i), x_i \in X \subset {\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt; with an MRI image and a dense labelling of every voxel coordinate. The anatomical labelling of parcellated structures are manual delineations by neuroanatomists.

The Bayes segmentation problem&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Bayesian Parameter Estimation and Segmentation in the Multi-Atlas Random Orbit Model |journal = PLOS ONE|date = 2013-06-18|pmc = 3688886|pmid = 23824159|pages = e65591|volume = 8|issue = 6|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0065591|first = Xiaoying|last = Tang|first2 = Kenichi|last2 = Oishi|first3 = Andreia V.|last3 = Faria|first4 = Argye E.|last4 = Hillis|first5 = Marilyn S.|last5 = Albert|first6 = Susumu|last6 = Mori|first7 = Michael I.|last7 = Miller|bibcode = 2013PLoSO...865591T}}&lt;/ref&gt; is given measurement &lt;math&gt;I^D&lt;/math&gt; with mean field and parcellation &lt;math&gt;(I,W)&lt;/math&gt;, the anatomical labelling &lt;math&gt;\theta \doteq W&lt;/math&gt;. mustg be estimated for the measured MRI image. The mean-field of the observable &lt;math&gt; I^D  &lt;/math&gt; image is modelled as a random deformation from one of the templates &lt;math&gt; I \doteq \varphi \cdot I_a &lt;/math&gt;, which is also randomly selected, &lt;math&gt; A = a &lt;/math&gt;,. The optimal diffeomorphism &lt;math&gt; \varphi  \in \mathcal{G} &lt;/math&gt; is hidden and acts on the background space of coordinates of the randomly selected template image &lt;math&gt; I_a  &lt;/math&gt;. Given a single atlas &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt;, the likelihood model for inference is determined by the joint probability &lt;math&gt; p(I^D,W\mid A = a) &lt;/math&gt;; with multiple atlases, the fusion of the likelihood functions yields the multi-modal mixture model with the prior averaging over models.

The MAP estimator of segmentation  &lt;math&gt; W_a  &lt;/math&gt;  is the maximizer  &lt;math&gt; \max_{W} \log p(W \mid I^D) &lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt; I^D  &lt;/math&gt;, which involves the mixture over all atlases.
:&lt;math&gt; \hat W \doteq \arg \textstyle \max_W \displaystyle \log p(I^D,W) \text{ with }  p(I^D,W) =\textstyle \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \displaystyle p(I^D,W\mid A = a)\pi _A(a). &lt;/math&gt;

The quantity &lt;math&gt; p(I^D,W) &lt;/math&gt; is computed via a fusion of likelihoods from multiple deformable atlases, with &lt;math&gt; \pi _A(a) &lt;/math&gt; being the prior probability that the observed image evolves from the specific template image &lt;math&gt; I_a &lt;/math&gt;.

The MAP segmentation can be iteratively solved via the [[Expectation–maximization algorithm|expectation-maximization]] algorithm

:&lt;math&gt; W^\text{new} \doteq \arg \max_W \int \log p(W,I^D,A, \varphi ) \, dp(A,\varphi \mid W^\text{old},I^D). &lt;/math&gt;

== MAP estimation of volume templates from populations and the EM algorithm ==
Generating templates empirically from populations is a fundamental operation ubiquitous to the discipline.
Several methods based on Bayesian statistics have emerged for submanifolds and dense image volumes.
For the dense image volume case, given the observable &lt;math&gt; I^{D_1}, I^{D_2}, \dots &lt;/math&gt; the problem is to estimate the template in the orbit of dense images &lt;math&gt; I \in \mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt;.  Ma's procedure takes an initial hypertemplate &lt;math&gt; I_0 \in \mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt; as the starting point, and models the template in the orbit under the unknown to be estimated diffeomorphism &lt;math&gt; I \doteq \varphi_0 \cdot I_0 &lt;/math&gt;, with the parameters to be estimated the log-coordinates &lt;math&gt;\theta \doteq v_0&lt;/math&gt; determining the geodesic mapping of the hyper-template &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v_0) \cdot I_0 = I \in \mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;.

In the [[Computational anatomy#The random orbit model of computational anatomy|Bayesian random orbit model of computational anatomy]] the observed MRI images &lt;math&gt;I^{D_i}&lt;/math&gt; are modelled as a conditionally Gaussian random field with mean field &lt;math&gt;\varphi_i \cdot I&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\varphi_i&lt;/math&gt; a random unknown transformation of the template.  The MAP estimation problem is to estimate the unknown template &lt;math&gt; I \in \mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; given the observed MRI images.

Ma's procedure for dense imagery takes an initial hypertemplate &lt;math&gt; I_0 \in \mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt; as the starting point, and models the template in the orbit under the unknown to be estimated diffeomorphism &lt;math&gt; I \doteq \varphi_0 \cdot I_0 &lt;/math&gt;.  The observables are modelled as conditional random fields, &lt;math&gt; I^{D_i} &lt;/math&gt; a {{EquationNote|conditional-Gaussian}} random field with mean field &lt;math&gt; \varphi_i \cdot I \doteq \varphi_i \cdot \varphi_0 \cdot I_0 &lt;/math&gt;.  The unknown variable to be estimated explicitly by MAP is the mapping of the hyper-template &lt;math&gt; \varphi_0&lt;/math&gt;, with the other mappings considered as nuisance or hidden variables which are integrated out via the Bayes procedure.  This is accomplished using the [[expectation-maximization]] algorithm.

The orbit-model is exploited by associating the unknown to be estimated flows to their log-coordinates &lt;math&gt;v_i,i=1,\dots&lt;/math&gt; [[Computational anatomy#Riemannian exponential (geodesic positioning) and Riemannian logarithm (geodesic coordinates)|via the Riemannian geodesic log and exponential]] for [[computational anatomy]] the initial vector field in the tangent space at the identity so that &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v_{i}) \doteq \varphi_i &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v_{0}) &lt;/math&gt; the mapping of the hyper-template.
The MAP estimation problem becomes

:&lt;math&gt;
\max_{v_0} p(I^D, \theta = v_0) = \int p(I^D, \theta= v_0\mid v_1,v_2, \dots ) \pi(v_1,v_2, \dots ) \, dv
&lt;/math&gt;

The EM algorithm takes as complete data the vector-field coordinates parameterizing the mapping, &lt;math&gt;v_i,i=1,\dots&lt;/math&gt; and compute iteratively the conditional-expectation
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
Q(\theta=v_0; \theta^\text{old}=v_0^\text{old}) &amp;
= - \operatorname{E} ( \log p(I^D, \theta=v_0 \mid v_1,v_2,\dots)\mid I^D, \theta^\text{old}) \\
&amp; = - \| ( \bar I^\text{old} - I_0 \circ \operatorname{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v_0)^{-1} ) \sqrt{\beta^\text{old}} \|^2 - \|v_0\|_V^2
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
* Compute new template maximizing Q-function, setting
:: &lt;math&gt;\theta^\text{new}\doteq v_0^\text{new} = \arg \max_{\theta = v_0} Q(\theta ; \theta^\text{old}=v_0^\text{old}) = - \left\| ( \bar I^\text{old} - I_0 \circ \operatorname{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v_0)^{-1} ) \sqrt{\beta^\text{old}} \right\|^2

'''Computational anatomy''' is an interdisciplinary field of [[biology]] focused on quantitative investigation and modelling of anatomical shapes variability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://team.inria.fr/asclepios/research/computational-anatomy/|title=Computational Anatomy – Asclepios|website=team.inria.fr|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://icm.jhu.edu/research-areas-2/computational-anatomy/|title=JHU – Institute for Computational Medicine {{!}} Computational Anatomy|website=icm.jhu.edu|access-date=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the development and application of mathematical, statistical and data-analytical methods for modelling and simulation of biological structures.

The field is broadly defined and includes foundations in [[anatomy]], [[applied mathematics]] and [[pure mathematics]], [[machine learning]], [[computational mechanics]], [[computational science]], [[biological imaging]], [[neuroscience]], [[physics]], [[probability]], and [[statistics]]; it also has strong connections with [[fluid mechanics]] and [[geometric mechanics]]. Additionally, it complements newer, interdisciplinary fields like [[bioinformatics]] and [[neuroinformatics]] in the sense that its interpretation uses metadata derived from the original sensor imaging modalities (of which [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] is one example). It focuses on the anatomical structures being imaged, rather than the medical imaging devices. It is similar in spirit to the history of [[Computational linguistics]], a discipline that focuses on the linguistic structures rather than the [[sensor]] acting as the [[transmission medium|transmission]] and communication media.

In computational anatomy, the [[diffeomorphism]] group is used to study different coordinate systems via [[change of basis|coordinate transformations]] as generated via the [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Lagrangian and Eulerian velocities of flow]] in &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt;. The [[#Lagrangian and Eulerian flows for generating diffeomorphisms|flows between coordinates in computational anatomy]] are constrained to be [[#The Metric on geodesic flows of landmarks, surfaces, and volumes within the orbit|geodesic flows]] satisfying [[#The action integral for Hamilton's principle on diffeomorphic flows|the principle of least action for the Kinetic energy of the flow]]. The kinetic energy is defined through a [[#The Sobolev smoothness condition on vector fields as modeled in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space|Sobolev smoothness]] norm with strictly more than two generalized, [[square-integrable function|square-integrable]] derivatives for each component of the flow velocity, which guarantees that the flows in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; are diffeomorphisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Variational Problems on Flows of Diffeomorphisms for Image Matching|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2693614|website=ResearchGate|access-date=2016-02-20|last1=Dupuis|first1=Paul|authorlink=|last2=Grenander|first2=Ulf|authorlink2=|authorlink3=|last3=Miller, Michael|author-first#=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It also implies that the [[#The Sobolev smoothness condition on vector fields as modeled in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space|diffeomorphic shape momentum]] taken pointwise satisfying the [[#The Euler–Lagrange equation on shape momentum for geodesics on the group of diffeomorphisms|Euler-Lagrange equation for geodesics]] is determined by its neighbors through spatial derivatives on the velocity field.  This separates the discipline from the case of [[Incompressible flow|incompressible fluids]]&lt;ref name=MR202082&gt;{{Cite journal|mr=202082|title=Sur la géomérie différentielle des groupes de Lie de dimension infinie et ses applications à l'hydrodynamique des fluides parfaits|journal=Ann.

Computational anatomy intersects the study of [[Riemannian manifolds]] and nonlinear [[global analysis]], where groups of diffeomorphisms are the central focus. Emerging high-dimensional theories of shape&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Laurent Younes|title=Shapes and Diffeomorphisms|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783642120541|date=2010-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are central to many studies in computational anatomy, as are questions emerging from the fledgling field of [[shape statistics]].
The metric structures in computational anatomy are related in spirit to [[morphometrics]], with the distinction that Computational anatomy focuses on an infinite-dimensional space of [[coordinate system]]s transformed by a [[diffeomorphism]], hence the central use of the terminology [[#Diffeomorphometry: The Metric Space of Shapes and Forms|'''diffeomorphometry''']], the metric space study of coordinate systems via diffeomorphisms.

==Genesis==
At computational anatomy's heart is the comparison of shape by recognizing in one shape the other. This connects it to [[D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson]]'s developments [[On Growth and Form]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;which has led to scientific explanations of [[morphogenesis]], the process by which [[patterns]] are formed in [[Biology]]. [[Albrecht Dürer|Albrecht Durer]]'s Four Books on Human Proportion were arguably the earliest works on computational anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/hierinnsindbegri00dure|title=Hierinn sind begriffen vier Bucher von menschlicher Proportion durch Albrechten Durer von Nurerberg [sic.] erfunden und beschuben zu nutz allen denen so zu diser kunst lieb tragen|last=Durer|first=Albrecht|year=1528|publisher=Hieronymus Andreae Formschneider}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.uthscsa.edu/2012/03/albrecht-durers-human-proportions/|title=Albrecht Dürer's Human Proportions " UT Health Science Center Library|last=Library|first=State of Texas, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio|website=library.uthscsa.edu|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.themorgan.org/collection/printed-books-and-bindings/73192|title=Albrecht Dürer|website=The Morgan Library &amp; Museum|access-date=2016-03-16|date=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efforts of [[Noam Chomsky]] in his pioneering of [[Computational Linguistics]] inspired the original formulation of computational anatomy as a generative model of shape and form from exemplars acted upon via transformations.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Computational Anatomy: An Emerging Discipline|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=309082.309089|journal=Q.

Due to the availability of dense 3D measurements via technologies such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), computational anatomy has emerged as a subfield of [[medical imaging]] and [[bioengineering]] for extracting anatomical coordinate systems at the morphome scale in 3D. The spirit of this discipline shares strong overlap with areas such as [[computer vision]] and [[kinematics]] of [[rigid bodies]], where objects are studied by analysing the [[group (mathematics)|groups]] responsible for the movement in question. Computational anatomy departs from computer vision with its focus on rigid motions, as the infinite-dimensional diffeomorphism group is central to the analysis of Biological shapes. It is a branch of the image analysis and pattern theory school at Brown University&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Brown University -- Pattern Theory Group: Home|url=http://www.dam.brown.edu/ptg/participants.shtml|website=www.dam.brown.edu|accessdate=2015-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; pioneered by [[Ulf Grenander]]. In Grenander's general Metric [[Pattern Theory]], making spaces of '''patterns''' into a [[Complete metric space|metric space]] is one of the fundamental operations since being able to cluster and recognize anatomical configurations often requires a metric of close and far between shapes. The [[#The Right Invariant Metric on Diffeomorphism|diffeomorphometry metric]]&lt;ref name="Miller 36"/&gt; of Computational anatomy measures how far two diffeomorphic changes of coordinates are from each other, which in turn induces a [[#The Metric on Shapes and Forms|metric on the shapes and images]] indexed to them. The models of metric pattern theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=General Pattern Theory : A Mathematical Study of Regular Structures|author=Grenander, Ulf|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198536710}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pattern Theory: From Representation to Inference|author=U. Grenander and M. I. Miller|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2007-02-08|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199297061}}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular group action on the orbit of shapes and forms is a central tool to the formal definitions in Computational anatomy.

==History==
Computational anatomy is the study of shape and form at the [[morphome]] or [[gross anatomy]] millimeter, or [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] scale, focusing on the study of sub-[[manifolds]] of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^3,&lt;/math&gt; points, curves surfaces and subvolumes of human anatomy.
An early modern computational neuro-anatomist was David Van Essen&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Two-dimensional maps of the cerebral cortex|journal=The Journal of Comparative Neurology|date=1980-05-15|pmid=7410593|pages=255–281|volume=191|issue=2|doi=10.1002/cne.901910208|first1=D. C.|last1=Van Essen|first2=J. H.|last2=Maunsell}}&lt;/ref&gt; performing some of the early physical unfoldings of the human brain based on printing of a human cortex and cutting. [[Jean Talairach|Jean Talairach's]]  publication of [[Talairach coordinates]] is an important milestone at the morphome scale demonstrating the fundamental basis of local coordinate systems in studying neuroanatomy and therefore the clear link to [[Differential geometry|charts of differential geometry]]. Concurrently, virtual mapping in computational anatomy across high resolution dense image coordinates was already happening in [[Ruzena Bajcsy|Ruzena Bajcy's]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Multiresolution Elastic Matching|journal=Comput. Vision Graph. Image Process.|date=1989-04-01|pages=1–21|volume=46|issue=1|doi=10.1016/S0734-189X(89)80014-3|first1=Ruzena|last1=Bajcsy|first2=Stane|last2=Kovačič}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fred Bookstein's&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Principal Warps: Thin-Plate Splines and the Decomposition of Deformations|journal=IEEE Trans.

L.|last=Bookstein|s2cid=47302}}&lt;/ref&gt;  earliest developments based on [[Computed Tomography|Computed axial tomography]] and [[Magnetic resonance imaging|Magnetic resonance imagery]].
The earliest introduction of the use of flows of diffeomorphisms for transformation of coordinate systems in image analysis and medical imaging was by Christensen, Joshi, Miller, and Rabbitt.&lt;ref name="Christensen"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tVVGAQAAIAAJ|title=A deformable neuroanatomy textbook based on viscous fluid mechanics: Proceedings of the ...

The first formalization of computational anatomy as an orbit of exemplar templates under [[diffeomorphism]] [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]] was in the original lecture given by Grenander and Miller with that title in May 1997 at the 50th Anniversary of the Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown University,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|editor=Walter Freiberger|title=Current and Future Challenges in the Applications of Mathematics|journal=Quarterly of Applied Mathematics }}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent publication.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; This was the basis for the strong departure from much of the previous work on advanced methods for [[spatial normalization]] and [[image registration]] which were historically built on notions of addition and basis expansion. The structure preserving transformations central to the modern field of Computational Anatomy, [[homeomorphism]]s and [[diffeomorphism]]s carry smooth submanifolds smoothly. They are generated via [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Lagrangian and Eulerian flows]] which &lt;nowiki/&gt;satisfy a law of composition of functions forming the group property, but are not additive.

The original model of computational anatomy was as the triple, &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{G}, \mathcal{M}, \mathcal{P}) \ ,
&lt;/math&gt; the group  &lt;math&gt; g \in \mathcal{G} &lt;/math&gt;, the orbit of shapes and forms &lt;math&gt; m \in \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt;, and the probability laws &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; which encode the variations of the objects in the orbit. The template or collection of templates are elements in the orbit &lt;math&gt; m_\mathrm{temp} \in \mathcal {M} &lt;/math&gt; of shapes.

The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of the equations of motion of computational anatomy took off post 1997 with several pivotal meetings including the 1997 Luminy meeting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Colloque Mathematiques et reconnaissance de formes|url=https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~cohen/MSPCV/luminy.html|website=www.ceremade.dauphine.fr|accessdate=2015-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized by the Azencott&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Robert Azencott, mathématicien polyglotte {{!}} La Recherche|url=http://www.larecherche.fr/actualite/aussi/robert-azencott-mathematicien-polyglotte-01-12-2000-70634|website=www.larecherche.fr|access-date=2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; school at [[École Normale Supérieure|Ecole-Normale Cachan]] on the "Mathematics of Shape Recognition" and the 1998 Trimestre at [[Institut Henri Poincaré|Institute Henri Poincar]]é organized by [[David Mumford]] "Questions Mathématiques en Traitement du Signal et de l'Image"  which catalyzed the Hopkins-Brown-ENS Cachan groups and subsequent developments and connections of Computational anatomy to developments in global analysis.

The developments in computational anatomy included the establishment of the Sobelev smoothness conditions on the diffeomorphometry metric to insure existence of solutions of [[Calculus of variations|variational]] problems in the space of diffeomorphisms,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/mariom/AM282-01/PAPERS/LANDMARK/an-approach-of-pattern.pdf|title=An Approach of Pattern Recognition through Infinite Dimensional Diffeomorphism|date=|accessdate=|website=|last=Trouve|first=Alain|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304190038/http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/mariom/AM282-01/PAPERS/LANDMARK/an-approach-of-pattern.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":142"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Variational Problems on Flows of Diffeomorphisms for Image Matching|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=298828.298844|journal=Q.

These contributions of computational anatomy to the global analysis associated to the infinite dimensional manifolds of subgroups of the diffeomorphism group is far from trivial.

==The deformable template orbit model of computational anatomy==
The model of human anatomy is a deformable template, an orbit of exemplars under group action. Deformable template models have been central to Grenander's Metric Pattern theory, accounting for typicality via templates, and accounting for variability via transformation of the template. An orbit under group action as the representation of the deformable template is a classic formulation from differential geometry.  The space of shapes are denoted &lt;math&gt;m \in \mathcal {M}&lt;/math&gt;, with the [[Group action (mathematics)|group]] &lt;nowiki/&gt; &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{ G}, \circ )&lt;/math&gt; with law of composition &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt;; the action of the group on shapes is denoted &lt;math&gt;g \cdot m&lt;/math&gt;, where the action of the group &lt;math&gt;g \cdot m \in \mathcal{M}, m \in \mathcal {M}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to satisfy 
:&lt;math&gt; (g \circ g^\prime) \cdot m=g \cdot (g^\prime \cdot m)\in \mathcal { M} .&lt;/math&gt;

The orbit &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt; of the template becomes the space of all shapes, &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M} \doteq \{ m=g \cdot m_\mathrm{temp}, g \in \mathcal{G} \}&lt;/math&gt;, being homogenous under the action of the elements of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Medial-temporal-lobe-structures.png|alt=FIgure showing different examples of shapes and forms in computational anatomy from MR imager.|thumb|Figure depicting three medial temporal lobe structures amgydala, entorhinal cortex and hippocampus with fiducial landmarks depicted as well embedded in the MRI background.]]
The orbit model of computational anatomy is an abstract algebra - to be compared to [[linear algebra]]- since the groups act nonlinearly on the shapes. This is a generalization of the classical models of linear algebra, in which the set of finite dimensional &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^n &lt;/math&gt; vectors are replaced by the finite-dimensional anatomical submanifolds (points, curves, surfaces and volumes) and images of them, and the &lt;math&gt; n \times n &lt;/math&gt; matrices of linear algebra are replaced by coordinate transformations based on linear and affine groups and the more general high-dimensional diffeomorphism groups.

==Shapes and forms==
The central objects are shapes or forms in computational anatomy, one set of examples being the 0,1,2,3-dimensional submanifolds of &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, a second set of examples being images generated via [[medical imaging]] such as via [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]]. [[File:Subcortical-MRI-caudate-putamen.png|alt=Figure showing triangualted meshes generated from populations of many segmented MRI brains. Each different surface represents a different shape in shape space.|thumb|Triangulated mesh surfaces depicting subcortical structures amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, caudate, putamen, ventricles.The shapes are denoted &lt;math&gt;m(u), u \in U\subset {\mathbb R}^1 \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^2&lt;/math&gt; represented as triangulated meshes.]] The 0-dimensional manifolds are landmarks or fiducial points; 1-dimensional manifolds are curves such as sulcul and gyral curves in the brain; 2-dimensional manifolds correspond to boundaries of substructures in anatomy such as the subcortical structures of the [[midbrain]] or the gyral surface of the [[neocortex]];  subvolumes correspond to subregions of the human body, the [[heart]], the [[thalamus]], the kidney.

The landmarks &lt;math&gt; X \doteq \{ x_1,\dots,x_n \} \subset {\mathbb R}^3 \in \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt; are a collections of points with no other structure, delineating important fiducials within human shape and form (see associated landmarked image).
The sub-[[manifold]] shapes such as surfaces &lt;math&gt; X \subset {\mathbb R}^3 \in \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt; are collections of points modeled as parametrized by a local chart or [[immersion (mathematics)|immersion]] &lt;math&gt; m:U \subset {\mathbb R}^{1,2} \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m(u), u \in U&lt;/math&gt; (see Figure showing shapes as mesh surfaces).
The images such as MR images or DTI images &lt;math&gt;I \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, and are dense functions
&lt;math&gt; I(x), x \in X \subset {\mathbb R}^{1,2,3} &lt;/math&gt; are scalars, vectors, and matrices (see Figure showing scalar image).

==Groups and group actions==
{{Further|Group actions in computational anatomy}}[[File:T1-weighted-MRI.png|alt=Two-dimensional scalar image depicting a section through a 3D brain at the level of the subcortical structures showing white, gray and CSF matter.|thumb|Showing an MRI section through a 3D brain representing a scalar image &lt;math&gt;I(x), x \in {\mathbb R}^2&lt;/math&gt; based on T1-weighting.]][[Group (mathematics)|Group]]s and [[Group action (mathematics)|group actions]] are familiar to the Engineering community with the universal popularization and standardization of [[linear algebra]] as a basic model for analyzing [[signals and systems]] in [[mechanical engineering]], [[electrical engineering]] and [[applied mathematics]]. In linear algebra the matrix groups (matrices with inverses) are the central structure, with group action defined by the usual definition of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; as an &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix, acting on &lt;math&gt;x \in {\mathbb R}^n&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n \times 1&lt;/math&gt;  vectors; the orbit in linear-algebra is the set of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-vectors given by &lt;math&gt;y=A \cdot x \in {\mathbb R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, which is a group action of the matrices through the orbit of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^n&lt;/math&gt;.

The central group in computational anatomy defined on volumes in  &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt; are the [[diffeomorphisms]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G} \doteq Diff&lt;/math&gt; which are mappings with 3-components &lt;math&gt;\phi(\cdot)=(\phi_1(\cdot),\phi_2 (\cdot),\phi_3 (\cdot))&lt;/math&gt;, law of composition of functions &lt;math&gt; \phi \circ \phi^\prime (\cdot)\doteq \phi (\phi^\prime(\cdot)) &lt;/math&gt;, with inverse &lt;math&gt; \phi \circ \phi^{-1}(\cdot)=\phi ( \phi^{-1}(\cdot))=id&lt;/math&gt;.

Most popular are scalar images, &lt;math&gt;I(x),x \in {\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt;, with action on the right via the inverse.

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi \cdot I(x)=I \circ \phi^{-1} (x), x \in {\mathbb R}^3
&lt;/math&gt;.

For sub-[[manifold]]s &lt;math&gt; X \subset {\mathbb R}^3 \in \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt;, parametrized by a chart or [[immersion (mathematics)|immersion]] &lt;math&gt; m(u), u \in U &lt;/math&gt;, the diffeomorphic action the flow of the position

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi \cdot m(u) \doteq \phi\circ m(u), u \in U
&lt;/math&gt;.

Several [[group actions in computational anatomy]] have been defined.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Lagrangian and Eulerian flows for generating diffeomorphisms==
For the study of [[rigid body]] [[kinematics]], the low-dimensional matrix [[Lie groups]] have been the central focus. The matrix groups are low-dimensional mappings, which are diffeomorphisms that provide one-to-one correspondences between coordinate systems, with a smooth inverse. The [[matrix group]] of rotations and scales can be generated via a closed form finite-dimensional matrices which are solution of simple ordinary differential equations with solutions given by the matrix exponential.

For the study of deformable shape in computational anatomy, a more general diffeomorphism group has been the group of choice, which is the infinite dimensional analogue. The high-dimensional differeomorphism groups used in Computational Anatomy are generated via smooth flows  &lt;math&gt; \phi_t,  t \in [0,1] &lt;/math&gt; which satisfy the [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field]]s&lt;nowiki/&gt; as first introduced in.,&lt;ref name="Christensen"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Christensen 1435–14472"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Christensen|first1=G.

==The diffeomorphism group of computational anatomy==
The group of diffeomorphisms is very big. To ensure smooth flows of diffeomorphisms avoiding [[Advection#Solving the equation|shock-like solutions]] for the inverse,  the vector fields must be at least 1-time continuously differentiable in space.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;P. Dupuis, U. Grenander, M.I. Miller, Existence of Solutions on Flows of Diffeomorphisms, Quarterly of Applied Math, 1997.

1034, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; For diffeomorphisms on &lt;math&gt;  {\mathbb R}^3   &lt;/math&gt;, vector fields are modelled as elements of the Hilbert space  &lt;math&gt;(V, \|\cdot \|_V )&lt;/math&gt; using the [[Sobolev space|Sobolev]] embedding theorems so that each element  has strictly greater than 2 generalized square-integrable spatial derivatives (thus &lt;math&gt;v_i \in H_0^3, i=1,2,3,&lt;/math&gt; is sufficient), yielding 1-time continuously differentiable functions.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

The diffeomorphism group are flows with vector fields absolutely integrable in Sobolev norm:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;

{{Hide|Sobolev smoothness and Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space with Green's kernel|

===The Sobolev smoothness condition on vector fields as modeled in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space===

The modelling approach used in computational anatomy enforces a continuous differentiability condition on the vector fields by modelling the space of vector fields &lt;math&gt;(V, \|\cdot \|_V )&lt;/math&gt; as a [[reproducing kernel Hilbert space]] (RKHS), with the norm defined by a 1-1, differential operator&lt;math&gt; A: V \rightarrow V^*  &lt;/math&gt;, Green's inverse &lt;math&gt;K=A^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.  The norm of the Hilbert space is induced by the differential operator.  For &lt;math&gt; \sigma(v) \doteq Av \in V^*
&lt;/math&gt; a generalized function or distribution, define the linear form as &lt;math&gt; (\sigma|w)\doteq \int_{{\mathbb R}^3}  \sum_i w_i(x) \sigma_i(dx)
&lt;/math&gt;. This determines the norm on &lt;math&gt;(V, \|\cdot \|_V )&lt;/math&gt; according to
:&lt;math&gt; \langle v , w \rangle_V \doteq \int_X A v \cdot w dx, \ \|v\|_V^2 \doteq \int_X Av \cdot v dx, \ v,w \in V \ .
&lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is a differential operator, finiteness of the norm-square &lt;math&gt;  (Av|v) &lt; \infty
&lt;/math&gt; includes derivatives from the differential operator implying smoothness of the vector fields.The [[Sobolev embedding]] theorem arguments were made in&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; demonstrating that 1-continuous derivative is required for smooth flows.
For proper choice of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; (V,\|\cdot \|_V) &lt;/math&gt; is an RKHS with the operator &lt;math&gt; K=A^{-1}: V^* \rightarrow V &lt;/math&gt;  termed the [[Green's function for the three-variable Laplace equation|Green's]] operator generated from the [[Green's function]] (scalar case) for the vector field case. The Green's kernels associated to the differential operator smooths since the kernel  &lt;math&gt; k(\cdot,\cdot)

Oftentimes, the familiar Euclidean metric is not directly applicable because the patterns of shapes and images don't form a vector space. In the [[Riemannian Metric and Lie-Bracket Interpretation of the Euler Equation on Geodesics|Riemannian orbit model of computational anatomy]], diffeomorphisms acting on the forms &lt;math&gt;\phi \cdot m \in \mathcal {M}, \phi \in Diff_V, m \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; don't act linearly. There are many ways to define metrics, and for the sets associated to shapes the [[Hausdorff metric]] is another. The method we use to induce the [[Riemannian metric]] is&lt;nowiki/&gt; used to induce the metric on the orbit of shapes by defining it in terms of the metric length between diffeomorphic coordinate system transformations of the flows. Measuring the lengths of the geodesic flow between coordinates systems in the orbit of shapes is called '''diffeomorphometry'''.

==The action integral for Hamilton's principle on diffeomorphic flows==

In classical mechanics the evolution of physical systems is described by solutions to the Euler–Lagrange equations associated to the [[Least-action principle]] of [[Hamilton's principle|Hamilton]]. This is a standard way, for example of obtaining [[Newton's laws of motion]] of free particles. More generally, the Euler-Lagrange equations can be derived for systems of [[generalized coordinates]]. The Euler-Lagrange equation in computational anatomy describes the geodesic shortest path flows between coordinate systems of the diffeomorphism metric. In computational anatomy the generalized coordinates are the flow of the diffeomorphism and its Lagrangian velocity &lt;math&gt;\phi, \dot{\phi}&lt;/math&gt;, the two related via the Eulerian velocity &lt;math&gt;v \doteq \dot{\phi} \circ \phi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. 
[[Hamilton principle|Hamilton's principle]] for generating the Euler-Lagrange equation requires the action integral on the Lagrangian given by 
{{NumBlk|::|&lt;math&gt;J(\phi) \doteq \int_0^1 L(\phi_t,\dot \phi_t) dt \ ;&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Hamiltonian-Integrated-Lagrangian}}}}
the Lagrangian is given by the kinetic energy:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; 
 L(\phi_t, \dot \phi_t ) \doteq \frac{1}{2} \int_X A (\dot \phi_t \circ \phi_t^{-1}) \cdot (\dot \phi_t \circ \phi_t^{-1} ) dx
=\frac{1}{2} \int_X Av_t \cdot v_t \ dx \ .
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Lagrangian-Kinetic-Energy}}}}

==Diffeomorphic or Eulerian shape momentum==
In computational anatomy, &lt;math&gt;Av&lt;/math&gt; was first called the '''Eulerian or diffeomorphic shape momentum'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=MILLER|first1=MICHAEL I.|last2=TROUVÉ|first2=ALAIN|last3=YOUNES|first3=LAURENT|date=2006-01-31|title=Geodesic Shooting for Computational Anatomy|journal=Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision|volume=24|issue=2|pages=209–228|doi=10.1007/s10851-005-3624-0|pmc=2897162|pmid=20613972}}&lt;/ref&gt;  since when integrated against Eulerian velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; gives energy density, and since there is a [[#Conservation laws on diffeomorphic shape momentum for computational anatomy|conservation of diffeomorphic shape momentum]] which holds. The operator &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the generalized [[moment of inertia]] or inertial operator.

==The Euler–Lagrange equation on shape momentum for geodesics on the group of diffeomorphisms==
{{Further|Riemannian metric and Lie-bracket in computational anatomy}}

Classical calculation of the Euler-Lagrange equation from [[Hamilton principle|Hamilton's principle]] requires the perturbation of the Lagrangian on the vector field in the kinetic energy with respect to first order perturbation of the flow. This requires adjustment by the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket of vector field]], given by operator &lt;math&gt; ad_v: w \in V \mapsto V &lt;/math&gt;  which involves the Jacobian given by 
:&lt;math&gt; ad_v[w]\doteq [v,w]\doteq (Dv)w-(Dw)v \in V &lt;/math&gt;.

Defining the adjoint &lt;math&gt; ad_v^*: V^* \rightarrow V^*,  &lt;/math&gt; then the first order variation gives the Eulerian shape momentum &lt;math&gt;Av \in V^*&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the generalized equation:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dt} Av_t + ad_{v_t}^* (Av_t)=0  \ , \ t \in [0,1] \  ;
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|EL-General}}}}

meaning for all smooth &lt;math&gt; w \in V ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \int_X \left( \frac{d}{dt} Av_t + ad_{v_t}^* (Av_t) \right) \cdot w dx=\int_X \frac{d}{dt} Av_t \cdot  w dx + \int_X Av_t \cdot ((Dv_t)w-(Dw)v_t) dx=0 . &lt;/math&gt;

Computational anatomy is the study of the motions of submanifolds, points, curves, surfaces and volumes.
Momentum associated to points, curves and surfaces are all singular, implying the momentum is concentrated on subsets of &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt; which are dimension &lt;math&gt; \leq 2 &lt;/math&gt; in [[Lebesgue measure]]. In such cases, the energy is still well defined &lt;math&gt; (Av_t\mid v_t) &lt;/math&gt; since although &lt;math&gt; Av_t &lt;/math&gt; is a generalized function, the vector fields are smooth and the Eulerian momentum is understood via its action on smooth functions. The perfect illustration of this is even when it is a superposition of delta-diracs, the velocity of the coordinates in the entire volume move smoothly. The Euler-Lagrange equation ({{EquationNote|EL-General}}) on diffeomorphisms for generalized functions &lt;math&gt; Av \in V^* &lt;/math&gt; was derived in.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;M.I. Miller, A. Trouve, L. Younes, Geodesic Shooting in Computational Anatomy, IJCV, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Riemannian Metric and Lie-Bracket Interpretation of the Euler Equation on Geodesics|Riemannian Metric and Lie-Bracket Interpretation of the Euler-Lagrange Equation on Geodesics]] derivations are provided in terms of the adjoint operator and the Lie bracket for the group of diffeomorphisms. It has come to be called EPDiff equation for diffeomorphisms connecting to the Euler-Poincare method having been studied in the context of the inertial operator &lt;math&gt;A=identity&lt;/math&gt;  for incompressible, divergence free, fluids.&lt;ref name="Mumford" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holm|first1=DD|last2=Marsden|first2=JE|last3=Ratiu|first3=TS|year=1998|title=The Euler-Poincaré equations and semidirect products with applications to continuum theories|url=|journal=Adv.

In medical imaging and computational anatomy, positioning and coordinatizing shapes are fundamental operations; the system for positioning anatomical coordinates and shapes built on the metric and the Euler-Lagrange equation a geodesic positioning system as first explicated in Miller Trouve and Younes.&lt;ref name="Miller 36"/&gt;

The Riemannian exponential satisfies &lt;math&gt;
Exp_{id} (v_0)=\phi_1 &lt;/math&gt; for initial condition &lt;math&gt;\dot \phi_0=v_0&lt;/math&gt;, vector field dynamics &lt;math&gt;\dot \phi_t=v_t \circ \phi_t, t \in [0,1]

Whereas the vector fields are extended across the entire background space of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt;, the geodesic flows associated to the submanifolds has Eulerian shape momentum which evolves as a generalized function &lt;math&gt;Av_t \in V^*&lt;/math&gt; concentrated to the submanifolds.

&lt;/ref&gt;  the [[#Landmark or pointset geodesics|geodesics have Eulerian shape momentum which are a superposition of delta distributions]] travelling with the finite numbers of particles; the diffeomorphic flow of coordinates have velocities in the range of weighted Green's Kernels. For surfaces, the momentum is a [[#Surface geodesics|surface integral of delta distributions]] travelling with the surface.&lt;ref name="Miller 36" /&gt;

The geodesics connecting coordinate systems satisfying {{EquationNote|EL-General}} have stationarity of the Lagrangian. The Hamiltonian is given by the extremum along the path &lt;math&gt;t \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H(\phi,p)=\max_v H(\phi,p,v)
&lt;/math&gt;, equalling the {{EquationNote|Lagrangian-Kinetic-Energy}}  and is stationary along {{EquationNote|EL-General}}. Defining the geodesic velocity at the identity &lt;math&gt;v_0=\arg \max_v H(\phi_0,p_0,v)
&lt;/math&gt;, then along the geodesic

 &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Hamiltonian-Geodesics}}}}The stationarity of the Hamiltonian demonstrates the interpretation of the Lagrange multiplier as momentum; integrated against velocity &lt;math&gt;\dot \phi&lt;/math&gt; gives energy density. The canonical momentum has many names.

==The metric on geodesic flows of landmarks, surfaces, and volumes within the orbit==
In computational anatomy the submanifolds are pointsets, curves, surfaces and subvolumes which are the basic primitives. The geodesic flows between the submanifolds determine the distance, and form the basic measuring and transporting tools of [[diffeomorphometry]]. At  &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; the geodesic has vector field &lt;math&gt;v_0=K p_0&lt;/math&gt; determined by the conjugate momentum and the Green's kernel of the inertial operator defining the Eulerian momentum &lt;math&gt;K=A^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. The metric distance between coordinate systems connected via the geodesic determined by the induced distance between identity and group element:
:&lt;math&gt;d_{Diff_V}(id,\varphi)=\|Log_{id}(\varphi)\|_V=\|v_0 \|_V=\sqrt{2H(id,p_0)}&lt;/math&gt;

==[[Conservation law (physics)|Conservation law]]s on diffeomorphic shape momentum for computational anatomy==
Given the least-action there is a natural definition of momentum associated to generalized coordinates; the quantity acting against velocity gives energy. The field has studied two forms, the momentum associated to the Eulerian vector field termed '''Eulerian diffeomorphic shape momentum''', and the momentum associated to the initial coordinates or canonical coordinates termed '''canonical diffeomorphic shape momentum'''. Each has a conservation law. The conservation of momentum goes hand in hand with the {{EquationNote|EL-General}}. In computational anatomy, &lt;math&gt;Av&lt;/math&gt; is the Eulerian [[Momentum]] since when integrated against Eulerian velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; gives energy density; operator &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; the generalized [[moment of inertia]] or inertial operator which acting on the Eulerian velocity gives momentum which is conserved along the geodesic: {{NumBlk|:|

===High Angular Resolution Diffusion Image (HARDI) matching in computational anatomy===
{{Further|Group actions in computational anatomy|LDDMM#LDDMM ODF}}

High angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) addresses the well-known limitation of DTI, that is, DTI can only reveal one dominant fiber orientation at each location. HARDI measures diffusion along &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; uniformly distributed directions on the sphere and can characterize more complex fiber geometries. HARDI can be used to reconstruct an [[orientation distribution function]] (ODF) that characterizes the angular profile of the diffusion probability density function of water molecules. The ODF is a function defined on a unit sphere, &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb{S}}^2 &lt;/math&gt;.

Dense LDDMM ODF matching &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Du|first1=J|last2=Goh|first2=A|last3=Qiu|first3=A|title=Diffeomorphic metric mapping of high angular resolution diffusion imaging based on Riemannian structure of orientation distribution functions|journal=IEEE Trans Med Imaging|date=2012|volume=31|issue=5|pages=1021–1033|doi=10.1109/TMI.2011.2178253|pmid=22156979}}&lt;/ref&gt; takes the HARDI data as ODF at each voxel and solves the LDDMM variational problem in the space of ODF. In the field of [[information geometry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Amari|first1=S|title=Differential-Geometrical Methods in Statistics|date=1985|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; the space of ODF forms a Riemannian manifold with the Fisher-Rao metric. For the purpose of LDDMM ODF mapping, the square-root representation is chosen because it is one of the most efficient representations found to date as the various Riemannian operations, such as geodesics, exponential maps, and logarithm maps, are available in closed form. In the following, denote square-root ODF (&lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{\text{ODF}}} &lt;/math&gt;) as &lt;math&gt; \psi({\bf s}) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \psi({\bf s}) &lt;/math&gt; is non-negative to ensure uniqueness and &lt;math&gt; \int_{{\bf s}\in  {\mathbb{S}}^2} \psi^2({\bf s}) d{\bf s}=1&lt;/math&gt;. The variational problem for matching assumes that two ODF volumes can be generated from one to another via flows of diffeomorphisms &lt;math&gt; \phi_t &lt;/math&gt;, which are solutions of ordinary differential equations &lt;math&gt; \dot \phi_t=v_t (\phi_t), t \in [0,1], &lt;/math&gt; starting from the identity map &lt;math&gt;\phi_0={id} &lt;/math&gt;. Denote the action of the diffeomorphism on template  as &lt;math&gt;\phi_1 \cdot \psi_{\mathrm{temp}}({\bf s},x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; {\bf s} \in {{\mathbb{S}}^2} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; x \in X &lt;/math&gt; are respectively the coordinates of the unit sphere, &lt;math&gt; {{\mathbb{S}}^2} &lt;/math&gt; and the image domain, with the target indexed similarly, &lt;math&gt;\psi_{\mathrm{targ}}({\bf s}, x)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt; {\bf s} \in {{\mathbb{S}}^2} &lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt; x \in X &lt;/math&gt;.

The group action of the diffeomorphism on the template is given according to
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_1 \cdot \psi (x)\doteq  (D\phi_1) \psi \circ \phi_1^{-1}(x), x \in X &lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt; (D\phi_1) &lt;/math&gt; is the Jacobian of the affined transformed ODF and is defined as
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(D \phi_1) \psi\circ \phi_1^{-1}(x)=\sqrt{\frac{\det{\bigl(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1}} }{\left\|{\bigl(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1} } {\bf s} \right\|^3} } \quad
\psi \left( \frac{(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1} {\bf s}}{\|(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1} {\bf s}\|}, \phi_1^{-1}(x) \right) .
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This group action of diffeomorphisms on ODF reorients the ODF and reflects changes in both the magnitude of &lt;math&gt; \psi &lt;/math&gt; and the sampling directions of &lt;math&gt; \bf s &lt;/math&gt; due to affine transformation. It guarantees that the volume fraction of fibers oriented toward a small patch must remain the same after the patch is transformed. 

The LDDMM variational problem is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
C(v)=\inf_{v: \dot \phi_t=
v_t \circ \phi_t,\phi_0={
id}}\int_0^1 \int_X Av_t \cdot v_t dx \ dt 
 +\lambda \int_{x\in\Omega}\|\log_{(D\phi_1) \psi_{\mathrm{temp}} \circ \phi_1^{-1}(x)}(\psi_{\mathrm{targ}}(x))\|^2_{(D\phi_1) \psi_{\mathrm{temp}}\circ \phi_1^{-1}(x)}dx 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;.

where the logarithm of &lt;math&gt; \psi_1, \psi_2 \in \Psi &lt;/math&gt; is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\|\log_{\psi_1}(\psi_2)\|_{\psi_1} 
=\cos^{-1} \langle \psi_1, \psi_2 \rangle=
\cos^{-1}\left(\int_{{\bf s}\in {\mathbb{S}}^2} \psi_1({\bf s}) \psi_2({\bf s})d{\bf s}\right),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is the normal dot product between points in the sphere under the &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{L}^2 &lt;/math&gt; metric.

The principle mode of variation represented by the orbit model is change of coordinates. For setting in which pairs of images are not related by diffeomorphisms but have photometric variation or image variation not represented by the template, [[active appearance model]]ling has been introduced, originally by Edwards-Cootes-Taylor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Active appearance models|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|date=1998-06-02|isbn=9783540646136|pages=484–498|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|first1=T.

For image matching the image metamorphosis framework enlarges the action so that &lt;math&gt; t \mapsto (\phi_t,I_t) &lt;/math&gt; with action &lt;math&gt; \phi_t \cdot I_t \doteq I_t \circ \phi_t^{-1}  &lt;/math&gt;. In this setting metamorphosis combines both the diffeomorphic coordinate system transformation of computational anatomy as well as the early [[morphing]] technologies which only faded or modified the photometric or image intensity alone.

Then the matching problem takes a form with equality boundary conditions:
:&lt;math&gt;
\min_{(v,I)}
\frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 \left( \int_X A v_t \cdot v_t dx +
\|\dot I_t \circ \phi_t^{-1} \|^2 / \sigma^2 \right) \, dt  \text{ subject to} \ \phi_0=id, I_0=\text{fixed}, I_1=\text{fixed}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Matching landmarks, curves, surfaces==
Transforming coordinate systems based on [[Landmark point]] or [[fiducial marker]] features dates back to Bookstein's early work on small deformation spline methods&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Principal Warps: Thin-Plate Splines and the Decomposition of Deformations|url=http://www.computer.org/csdl/trans/tp/1989/06/i0567.pdf|journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence|date=1989-01-01|pages=567–585|volume=11|issue=6|doi=10.1109/34.24792|first=F. L.|last=Bookstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; for interpolating correspondences defined by fiducial points to the two-dimensional or three-dimensional background space in which the fiducials are defined. Large deformation landmark methods came on in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="Miller 209–228"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Joshi 1357–1370"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Geodesic Interpolating Splines|url=|doi=10.1007/3-540-44745-8_34|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|date=2001-09-03|isbn=9783540425236|pages=513–527|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|first1=Vincent|last1=Camion|first2=Laurent|last2=Younes|editor-first=Mário|editor-last=Figueiredo|editor-first2=Josiane|editor-last2=Zerubia|editor-first3=Anil K.|editor-last3=Jain|citeseerx=10.1.1.57.7394}}&lt;/ref&gt; The above Figure depicts a series of landmarks associated three brain structures, the amygdala, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus.

Matching geometrical objects like unlabelled point distributions, curves or surfaces is another common problem in computational anatomy. Even in the discrete setting where these are commonly given as vertices with meshes, there are no predetermined correspondences between points as opposed to the situation of landmarks described above. From the theoretical point of view, while any submanifold &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; d=1,2,3 &lt;/math&gt; can be parameterized in local charts &lt;math&gt; m: u \in U \subset {\mathbb R}^{0,1,2,3} \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, all reparametrizations of these charts give geometrically the same manifold. Therefore, early on in computational anatomy, investigators have identified the necessity of parametrization invariant representations. One indispensable requirement is that the end-point matching term between two submanifolds is itself independent of their parametrizations. This can be achieved via concepts and methods borrowed from [[Geometric measure theory]], in particular [[Current (mathematics)|currents]]&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal |date=2005-01-01|pmid=17354711|pages=381–392|volume=19|first1=Marc|last1=Vaillant|first2=Joan|last2=Glaunès|s2cid=5103312|title=Surface matching via currents|journal=Information Processing in Medical Imaging : Proceedings of the ...

===Measure matching: unregistered landmarks===
Glaunes and co-workers first introduced diffeomorphic matching of pointsets in the general setting of matching distributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Glaunes|first1=J.|last2=Trouve|first2=A.|last3=Younes|first3=L.|date=2004-06-01 |volume=2|pages=II–712–II–718 Vol.2|doi=10.1109/CVPR.2004.1315234|isbn=978-0-7695-2158-9|citeseerx=10.1.1.158.4209|chapter=Diffeomorphic matching of distributions: A new approach for unlabelled point-sets and sub-manifolds matching|title=Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2004. CVPR 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to landmarks, this includes in particular the situation of weighted point clouds with no predefined correspondences and possibly different cardinalities. The template and target discrete point clouds are represented as two weighted sums of Diracs &lt;math&gt; \mu_{m}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} \rho_i \delta_{x_i} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mu_{m^\prime}=\sum_{i=1}^{n^\prime} \rho^{\prime}_{i} \delta_{x^{\prime}_{i}} &lt;/math&gt; living in the space of [[signed measure]]s of &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;. The space is equipped with a Hilbert metric obtained from a real positive kernel &lt;math&gt; k(x,y) &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, giving the following norm:

: &lt;math&gt;
\|\mu_{m} \|_\mathrm{mea}^2=\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} \rho_i \rho_j k(x_i,x_j)
&lt;/math&gt;

The matching problem between a template and target point cloud may be then formulated using this kernel metric for the endpoint matching term:

: &lt;math&gt;
\min_{\phi: v=\dot \phi \circ \phi^{-1}} C(\phi) \doteq \frac{1}{2} \int
     (Av_t\mid v_t) \, dt  +\frac{1}{2} \|\mu_{\phi_1 \cdot m} - \mu_{m^\prime} \|_\mathrm{mea}^2
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mu_{\phi_1 \cdot m}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} \rho_i \delta_{\phi_1(x_i)} &lt;/math&gt; is the distribution transported by the deformation.

===Curve matching===
In the one dimensional case, a curve in 3D can be represented by an embedding &lt;math&gt; m: u \in [0,1] \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, and the group action of ''Diff'' becomes &lt;math&gt; \phi \cdot m=\phi \circ m&lt;/math&gt;. However, the correspondence between curves and embeddings is not one to one as the any reparametrization &lt;math&gt;m \circ \gamma&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; a diffeomorphism of the interval [0,1], represents geometrically the same curve. In order to preserve this invariance in the end-point matching term, several extensions of the previous 0-dimensional measure matching approach can be considered.

* '''Curve matching with currents'''
In the situation of oriented curves, currents give an efficient setting to construct invariant matching terms. In such representation, curves are interpreted as elements of a functional space dual to the space vector fields, and compared through kernel norms on these spaces. Matching of two curves &lt;math&gt; m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; m^\prime&lt;/math&gt; writes eventually as the variational problem

: &lt;math&gt;
\min_{\phi: v=\dot \phi \circ \phi^{-1}} C(\phi) \doteq \frac{1}{2} \int
     (Av_t\mid v_t) \, dt  +\frac{1}{2} \|\mathcal{C}_{\phi_1 \cdot m} - \mathcal{C}_{m^\prime} \|_\mathrm{cur}^2
&lt;/math&gt;

with the endpoint term &lt;math&gt; E(\phi_1)=\|\mathcal{C}_{\phi_1 \cdot m} - \mathcal{C}_{m^\prime} \|_\mathrm{cur}^2/2 &lt;/math&gt; is obtained from the norm

: &lt;math&gt;
\|\mathcal{C}_{m} \|_\mathrm{cur}^2=\int_0^1 \int_0^1 K_C(m(u),m(v)) \partial m(u) \cdot \partial m(v) \, du \, dv
&lt;/math&gt;

the derivative &lt;math&gt; \partial m(u)&lt;/math&gt; being the tangent vector to the curve and &lt;math&gt; K_{\mathcal{C}} &lt;/math&gt; a given matrix kernel of &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;. Such expressions are invariant to any positive reparametrizations of &lt;math&gt; m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; m'&lt;/math&gt;, and thus still depend on the orientation of the two curves.

* '''Curve matching with varifolds'''
Varifold is an alternative to currents when orientation becomes an issue as for instance in situations involving multiple bundles of curves for which no "consistent" orientation may be defined. Varifolds directly extend 0-dimensional measures by adding an extra tangent space direction to the position of points, leading to represent curves as measures on the product of &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt; and the [[Grassmannian]] of all straight lines in &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;. The matching problem between two curves then consists in replacing the endpoint matching term by &lt;math&gt; E(\phi_1)=\|\mathcal{V}_{\phi_1 \cdot m} - \mathcal{V}_{m^\prime} \|_{cur}^2/2 &lt;/math&gt; with varifold norms of the form:

: &lt;math&gt;
\|\mathcal{V}_m \|_{var}^2=\int_{0}^1 \int_{0}^1 k_{\mathbb{R}^3}(m(u),m(v)) k_{\mathbf{Gr}}\left([\partial m(u)],[\partial m(v)] \right) {{|}}\partial m(u){{|}} {{|}}\partial m(v) {{|}} \, du \, dv 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; [\partial m(u)]&lt;/math&gt; is the non-oriented line directed by tangent vector &lt;math&gt; \partial m(u)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_{\mathbb{R}^3}, k_{\mathbf{Gr}}&lt;/math&gt; two scalar kernels respectively on  &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; and the Grassmannian. Due to the inherent non-oriented nature of the Grassmannian representation, such expressions are invariant to positive and negative reparametrizations.

===Surface matching===
Surface matching share many similarities with the case of curves. Surfaces in &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt; are parametrized in local charts by embeddings &lt;math&gt; m: u \in U \subset {\mathbb R}^{2} \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, with all reparametrizations &lt;math&gt; m\circ \gamma &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; a diffeomorphism of U being equivalent geometrically. Currents and varifolds can be also used to formalize surface matching.

* '''Surface matching with currents'''
Oriented surfaces can be represented as 2-currents which are dual to differential 2-forms. In &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, one can further identify 2-forms with vector fields through the standard wedge product of 3D vectors. In that setting, surface matching writes again:

: &lt;math&gt;
\min_{\phi: v=\dot \phi \circ \phi^{-1}} C(\phi) \doteq \frac{1}{2} \int
     (Av_t\mid v_t) \, dt  +\frac{1}{2} \|\mathcal{C}_{\phi_1 \cdot m} - \mathcal{C}_{m^\prime} \|_\mathrm{cur}^2
&lt;/math&gt;

with the endpoint term &lt;math&gt; E(\phi_1)=\|\mathcal{C}_{\phi_1 \cdot m} - \mathcal{C}_{m^\prime} \|_\mathrm{cur}^2/2 &lt;/math&gt; given through the norm

: &lt;math&gt;
\|\mathcal{C}_{m} \|_\mathrm{cur}^2=\iint_{U\times U} K_C(m(u),m(v)) \vec{n}(u) \cdot \vec{n}(v) \, du \, dv
&lt;/math&gt;

* '''Surface matching with varifolds'''
For non-orientable or non-oriented surfaces, the varifold framework is often more adequate. Identifying the parametric surface &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; with a varifold &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{V}_m &lt;/math&gt; in the space of measures on the product of &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt; and the Grassmannian, one simply replaces the previous current metric &lt;math&gt; \|\mathcal{C}_{m} \|_\mathrm{cur}^2 &lt;/math&gt; by:

: &lt;math&gt;
\|\mathcal{V}_{m} \|_\mathrm{var}^2=\iint_{U\times U} k_{\mathbb{R}^3}(m(u),m(v)) k_{\mathbf{Gr}}\left([\vec{n}(u)],[\vec{n}(v)] \right) {{|}}\vec{n}(u){{|}} {{|}}\vec{n}(v) {{|}} \, du \, dv
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; [\vec{n}(u)] &lt;/math&gt; is the (non-oriented) line directed by the normal vector to the surface.

==Growth and atrophy from longitudinal time-series==

There are many settings in which there are a series of measurements, a time-series to which the underlying
coordinate systems will be matched and flowed onto. This occurs for example
in the dynamic growth and atrophy models and motion tracking such as have been explored in&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Computational anatomy: shape, growth, and atrophy comparison via diffeomorphisms|journal=NeuroImage|date=2004-01-01|pmid=15501089|pages=S19–33|volume=23 Suppl 1|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.07.021|first=Michael I.|last=Miller|citeseerx=10.1.1.121.4222}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Geodesic regression for image time-series|journal=Medical Image Computing and Computer-assisted Intervention: MICComputational AnatomyI ...

==Statistical shape theory in computational anatomy==
{{Further|Statistical shape analysis|Shape theory (mathematics)}}

[[Shape]] in computational anatomy is a local theory, indexing shapes and structures to templates to which they are [[bijectively]] mapped. [[Statistical shape analysis|Statistical shape]] in computational anatomy is the empirical study of diffeomorphic correspondences between populations and common template coordinate systems.  This is a strong departure from [[Procrustes|Procrustes Analyses]] and shape theories pioneered by [[David George Kendall|David G. Kendall]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Survey of the Statistical Theory of Shape|jstor=2245331|journal=Statistical Science|date=1989-01-01|pages=87–99|volume=4|issue=2|first=David G.|last=Kendall|doi=10.1214/ss/1177012582|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that the central group of Kendall's theories are the finite-dimensional Lie groups, whereas the theories of shape in computational anatomy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1007/978-88-7642-387-1_4|publisher=Scuola Normale Superiore|date=2012-01-01|isbn=9788876423888|pages=43–53|series=Colloquia|first=David|last=Mumford|s2cid=116135355|editor-first=Umberto|editor-last=Zannier|title=Colloquium de Giorgi 2009|chapter=The geometry and curvature of shape spaces}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|edition=1st|title=Shapes and Diffeomorphisms|author=Laurent Younes|publisher=Springer|date=2010-05-25|isbn=9783642120541 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Spaces and Manifolds of Shapes in Computer Vision: An Overview|journal=Image Vision Comput.|date=2012-06-01|pages=389–397|volume=30|issue=6–7|doi=10.1016/j.imavis.2011.09.009|first=Laurent|last=Younes}}&lt;/ref&gt; have focused on the diffeomorphism group, which to first order via the Jacobian can be thought of as a field–thus infinite dimensional–of low-dimensional Lie groups of scale and rotations. 
[[File:Subcortical structures embedded in two-dimensional momentum space.png|alt=showing man sub-cortical structures|thumb|Figure showing hundreds of sub-cortical structures embedded in two-dimensional momentum space generated from the first two eigenvectors of the empirical co-variance estimated from the population of shapes.]]
The random orbit model provides the natural setting to understand empirical shape and shape statistics within computational anatomy since the non-linearity of the induced probability law on anatomical shapes and forms &lt;math&gt; m \in \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt; is induced via the reduction to the vector fields &lt;math&gt; v_0 \in V &lt;/math&gt; at the tangent space at the identity of the diffeomorphism group. The successive flow of the Euler equation induces the random space of shapes and forms &lt;math&gt;Exp_{id}(v_0) \cdot m \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.

Performing empirical statistics on this tangent space at the identity is the natural way for inducing probability laws on the statistics of shape. Since both the vector fields and the Eulerian momentum &lt;math&gt;Av_0&lt;/math&gt; are in a Hilbert space the natural model is one of a Gaussian random field, so that given test function &lt;math&gt;w \in V&lt;/math&gt;, then the inner-products with the test functions are Gaussian distributed with mean and covariance.

This is depicted in the accompanying figure where sub-cortical brain structures are depicted in a two-dimensional coordinate system based on inner products of their initial vector fields that generate them from the template is shown in a 2-dimensional span of the Hilbert space.

The study of shape and statistics in populations are local theories, indexing shapes and structures to templates to which they are bijectively mapped. Statistical shape is then the study of diffeomorphic correspondences relative to the template. A core operation is the generation of templates from populations, estimating a shape that is matched to the population.

'''[[Group action (mathematics)|Group action]]s''' are central to [[Riemannian geometry]] and defining [[Orbit (control theory)|orbits (control theory)]]. 
The orbits of [[computational anatomy]] consist of [[Computational anatomy#Shapes and forms|anatomical shapes and medical images]]; the anatomical  shapes are submanifolds of [[differential geometry]] consisting of points, curves, surfaces and subvolumes,.
This generalized the ideas of the more familiar orbits of [[linear algebra]] which are [[Vector space|linear vector spaces]].   Medical images are scalar and tensor images from [[medical imaging]]. The group actions are used to define models of human shape which accommodate variation. These orbits are deformable templates as originally formulated more abstractly in [[pattern theory]].

==The orbit model of computational anatomy==
The central model of human anatomy in computational anatomy is  a [[Computational anatomy#Orbits and groups actions|Groups and group action]], a classic formulation from [[differential geometry]].  The orbit is called the space of [[Computational anatomy#Shapes and forms|shapes and forms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Michael I.|last2=Younes|first2=Laurent|last3=Trouvé|first3=Alain|date=2014-03-01|title=Diffeomorphometry and geodesic positioning systems for human anatomy|journal=Technology|volume=2|issue=1|pages=36|doi=10.1142/S2339547814500010|issn=2339-5478|pmc=4041578|pmid=24904924}}&lt;/ref&gt; The space of shapes are denoted &lt;math&gt;m \in \mathcal {M}&lt;/math&gt;, with the [[Group action (mathematics)|group]] &lt;nowiki/&gt; &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{ G}, \circ )&lt;/math&gt; with law of composition &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt;; the action of the group on shapes is denoted &lt;math&gt;g \cdot m&lt;/math&gt;, where the action of the group &lt;math&gt;g \cdot m \in \mathcal{M}, m \in \mathcal {M}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to satisfy 
:&lt;math&gt; (g \circ g^\prime) \cdot m = g \cdot (g^\prime \cdot m)\in \mathcal { M} .&lt;/math&gt;

The orbit &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt; of the template becomes the space of all shapes, &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M} \doteq \{ m  = g \cdot m_\mathrm{temp}, g \in \mathcal{G} \}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Several group actions in computational anatomy==
{{Main|Computational anatomy}}
The central group in CA defined on volumes in  &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt; are [[Computational anatomy#The diffeomorphism group of computational anatomy|the diffeomorphism group]]  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G} \doteq \mathrm{Diff}&lt;/math&gt; which are mappings with 3-components &lt;math&gt;\phi(\cdot) = (\phi_1(\cdot),\phi_2 (\cdot),\phi_3 (\cdot))&lt;/math&gt;, law of composition of functions &lt;math&gt; \phi \circ \phi^\prime (\cdot)\doteq \phi (\phi^\prime(\cdot)) &lt;/math&gt;, with inverse &lt;math&gt; \phi \circ \phi^{-1}(\cdot) =\phi ( \phi^{-1}(\cdot))= \operatorname{id}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Submanifolds: organs, subcortical structures, charts, and immersions===
For sub-[[manifold]]s &lt;math&gt; X \subset {\mathbb R}^3 \in \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt;, parametrized by a chart or [[immersion (mathematics)|immersion]] &lt;math&gt; m(u), u \in U &lt;/math&gt;, the diffeomorphic action the flow of the position

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi \cdot m(u) \doteq \phi\circ m(u), u \in U
&lt;/math&gt;.

===Scalar images such as MRI, CT, PET===
Most popular are scalar images, &lt;math&gt;I(x),x \in {\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt;, with action on the right via the inverse.
:&lt;math&gt;
\phi \cdot I(x) = I \circ \phi^{-1} (x), x \in {\mathbb R}^3
&lt;/math&gt;.

===Oriented tangents on curves, eigenvectors  of tensor matrices===
Many different imaging modalities are being used with various actions. For images such that &lt;math&gt; I(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a three-dimensional vector then

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi\cdot I = ((D\varphi) \, I)\circ \varphi^{-1} , &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi \star I =  ((D\varphi^T)^{-1}I) \circ \varphi^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Tensor matrices===
Cao et al.
&lt;ref&gt;Cao Y1, Miller MI, Winslow RL, Younes, Large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping of vector fields. IEEE Trans Med Imaging. 2005 Sep;24(9):1216-30.
&lt;/ref&gt; 
examined actions for mapping MRI images measured via diffusion tensor imaging and represented via there principle eigenvector. 
For tensor fields a positively oriented orthonormal basis 
&lt;math&gt;I(x) = (I_1 (x), I_2(x), I_3(x)) &lt;/math&gt;
of &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt;, termed frames, vector cross product denoted &lt;math&gt; I_1 \times I_2 &lt;/math&gt; then
:&lt;math&gt;
\varphi\cdot I =
  \left(\frac{D\varphi I_1}{\|D\varphi\,I_1\|}, \frac{(D\varphi^{ T})^{-1} I_3 \times
    D\varphi\,I_1}{\|(D\varphi^{ T})^{-1} I_3 \times D \varphi\,I_1\|}, 
\frac{(D\varphi^{ T})^{-1} I_3}{\|(D\varphi^{ T})^{-1} I_3\|}\right)\circ \varphi^{-1} \ ,
&lt;/math&gt;
The Fr\'enet frame of three orthonormal vectors, &lt;math&gt; I_1 &lt;/math&gt; deforms as a tangent, &lt;math&gt;
I_3
&lt;/math&gt; deforms like
a normal to the plane generated by &lt;math&gt;
I_1 \times I_2
&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;
I_3
&lt;/math&gt;. H is uniquely constrained by the
basis being positive and orthonormal.

For &lt;math&gt;

Orientation distribution function (ODF) characterizes the angular profile of the diffusion probability density function of water molecules and can be reconstructed from High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI). The ODF is a probability density function defined on a unit sphere, &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb{S}}^2 &lt;/math&gt;. In the field of [[information geometry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Amari|first1=S|title=Differential-Geometrical Methods in Statistics|date=1985|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; the space of ODF forms a Riemannian manifold with the Fisher-Rao metric. For the purpose of LDDMM ODF mapping, the square-root representation is chosen because it is one of the most efficient representations found to date as the various Riemannian operations, such as geodesics, exponential maps, and logarithm maps, are available in closed form. In the following, denote square-root ODF (&lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{\text{ODF}}} &lt;/math&gt;) as &lt;math&gt; \psi({\bf s}) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \psi({\bf s}) &lt;/math&gt; is non-negative to ensure uniqueness and &lt;math&gt; \int_{{\bf s}\in  {\mathbb{S}}^2} \psi^2({\bf s}) d{\bf s}=1&lt;/math&gt;.

Denote diffeomorphic transformation as &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt;. Group action of diffeomorphism on &lt;math&gt; \psi({\bf s}) &lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\phi \cdot \psi &lt;/math&gt;, needs to guarantee the non-negativity and &lt;math&gt; \int_{{\bf s}\in  {\mathbb{S}}^2} \phi \cdot \psi^2({\bf s}) d{\bf s}=1&lt;/math&gt;. Based on the derivation in,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Du|first1=J|last2=Goh|first2=A|last3=Qiu|first3=A|title=Diffeomorphic metric mapping of high angular resolution diffusion imaging based on Riemannian structure of orientation distribution functions|journal=IEEE Trans Med Imaging|date=2012|volume=31|issue=5|pages=1021–1033|doi=10.1109/TMI.2011.2178253|pmid=22156979|s2cid=11533837}}&lt;/ref&gt; this group action is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(D \phi) \psi\circ \phi^{-1}(x) =   \sqrt{\frac{\det{\bigl(D_{\phi^{-1}}\phi \bigr)^{-1}} }{\left\|{\bigl(D_{\phi^{-1}}\phi \bigr)^{-1} } {\bf s} \right\|^3} } \quad
\psi \left( \frac{(D_{\phi^{-1}}\phi \bigr)^{-1} {\bf s}}{\|(D_{\phi^{-1}}\phi \bigr)^{-1} {\bf s}\|}, \phi^{-1}(x) \right) , 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; (D\phi) &lt;/math&gt; is the Jacobian of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping''' ('''LDDMM''') is a specific suite of algorithms used for diffeomorphic mapping and manipulating dense imagery based on  '''diffeomorphic metric mapping''' within the academic discipline of [[computational anatomy]], to be distinguished from its precursor based on '''diffeomorphic mapping'''.  The distinction between the two is that diffeomorphic metric maps satisfy the property that the length associated to their flow away from the identity induces a metric on the [[Computational anatomy#The Diffeomorphism Group of Computational Anatomy|group of diffeomorphisms]], which in turn induces a metric on the orbit of [[Computational anatomy#Shapes and forms|shapes and forms]] within the field of [[Computational anatomy|Computational Anatomy]]. The study of shapes and forms with the metric of diffeomorphic metric mapping is called [[Computational Anatomy#Diffeomorphometry:the metric space of shapes and forms|diffeomorphometry]].

A '''diffeomorphic mapping''' system is a system designed to map, manipulate, and transfer information which is stored in many types of spatially distributed medical imagery.

Diffeomorphic mapping is the underlying technology for mapping and analyzing information measured in human anatomical coordinate systems which have been measured via Medical imaging{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. Diffeomorphic mapping is a broad term that actually refers to a number of different algorithms, processes, and methods. It is attached to many operations and has many applications for analysis and visualization. Diffeomorphic mapping can be used to relate various sources of information which are indexed as a function of spatial position as the key index variable. Diffeomorphisms are by their Latin root structure preserving transformations, which are in turn differentiable and therefore smooth, allowing for the calculation of metric based quantities such as arc length and surface areas. Spatial location and extents in human anatomical coordinate systems can be recorded via a variety of Medical imaging modalities, generally termed multi-modal medical imagery, providing either scalar and or vector quantities at each spatial location. Examples are scalar [[T1 (MRI)|T1]] or T2 [[Magnetic resonance imaging|magnetic resonance imagery]], or as 3x3 diffusion tensor matrices [[diffusion MRI]] and [[diffusion-weighted imaging]], to scalar densities associated to [[computed tomography]] (CT), or functional imagery such as temporal data of [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] and scalar densities such as [[Positron emission tomography|Positron emission tomography (PET)]].

Computational anatomy is a subdiscipline within the broader field of [[neuroinformatics]] within [[bioinformatics]] and [[medical imaging]].

The distinction between diffeomorphic metric mapping forming the basis for LDDMM and the earliest methods of diffeomorphic mapping is the introduction of a Hamilton principle of least-action in which large deformations are selected of shortest length corresponding to geodesic flows. This important distinction arises from the original formulation of the [[Riemannian metric and Lie-bracket in computational anatomy|Riemannian metric]] corresponding to the right-invariance. The lengths of these geodesics give the metric in the metric space structure of human anatomy. Non-geodesic formulations of diffeomorphic mapping in general does not correspond to any metric formulation.

The central focus of the sub-field of '''[[Computational anatomy]] (CA)''' within [[medical imaging]]  is mapping information across anatomical coordinate systems at the 1 millimeter [[morphome]] scale. In CA mapping of dense information measured within [[Magnetic resonance imaging|Magnetic resonance image]] (MRI) based coordinate systems such as in the brain has been solved via inexact matching of 3D MR images one onto the other. The earliest introduction of the use of '''diffeomorphic mapping''' via '''large deformation''' flows of [[diffeomorphisms]] for transformation of coordinate systems in image analysis and medical imaging was by Christensen, Rabbitt and Miller &lt;ref name="Christensen 1435–1447"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Deformable Templates Using Large Deformation Kinematics|journal=Trans.

This model becomes more appropriate for cross-sectional studies in which brains and or hearts are not necessarily deformations of one to the other. Methods based on linear or non-linear elasticity energetics which grows with distance from the identity mapping of the template, is not appropriate for cross-sectional study. Rather, in models based on Lagrangian and Eulerian flows of diffeomorphisms, the constraint is associated to topological properties, such as open sets being preserved, coordinates not crossing implying uniqueness and existence of the inverse mapping, and connected sets remaining connected.  The use of diffeomorphic methods grew quickly to dominate the field of mapping methods post Christensen's original paper, with fast and symmetric methods becoming available.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Avants|first=B.

Such methods are powerful in that they introduce notions of regularity of the solutions so that they can be differentiated and local inverses can be calculated. The disadvantages of these methods is that there was no associated global least-action property which could score the flows of minimum energy. This contrasts the geodesic motions which are central to the study of  [[Rigid-body kinematics|Rigid body kinematics]] and the many problems solved in [[Physics]] via&lt;nowiki/&gt; [[Hamilton's principal of least action|Hamilton's principle of least action]].

First Order Variation of the Flow and Vector Field for Dense Image and Landmark Matching|

The first order variation in the vector fields &lt;math&gt;v+\epsilon \delta v&lt;/math&gt; requires the variation of  &lt;math&gt;\phi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; generalizes the [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] [[Invertible matrix#Derivative of the matrix inverse|perturbation of the inverse]]  via &lt;math&gt;(\phi + \epsilon \delta \phi \circ \phi)\circ (\phi^{-1} + \epsilon \delta \phi^{-1} \circ \phi^{-1})=id + o(\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; giving  &lt;math&gt;\delta \phi^{-1} \circ \phi^{-1}=-(D \phi_1^{-1}) \delta \phi  &lt;/math&gt; . 
To express the variation in terms of &lt;math&gt; \delta v &lt;/math&gt;, use the solution to the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]]
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d }{d t} \left( \delta \phi_{|\phi} \right)=(Dv)_{|\phi} \delta \phi_{|\phi} + \delta v_{|\phi}&lt;/math&gt; giving
:&lt;math&gt;
\delta \phi_1=(D \phi_1)_{|\phi_1^{-1}} \int_0^1 (D \phi_t)_{|\phi_1^{-1}}^{-1} (\delta v_t )_{\phi_t \circ \phi_1^{-1} } dt
&lt;/math&gt;

*Image Matching:
Taking the directional derivative of the image endpoint condition &lt;math&gt; E(\phi)=\int_X|I \circ \phi^{-1} - J|^2 dx &lt;/math&gt; gives
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{d \epsilon} \frac{1}{2} \int_X|I \circ ( \phi^{-1} + \epsilon \delta \phi^{-1} \circ \phi^{-1})-J|^2 dx|_{\epsilon=0}
=\int_X (I \circ \phi^{-1} -J ) \nabla I|_{\phi^{-1}} \delta \phi^{-1} \circ \phi^{-1} dx
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;
=\int_X (I \circ \phi^{-1} -J ) \nabla I|_{\phi^{-1}} 
(-D \phi_1^{-1}) \delta \phi dx
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=\int_X(I \circ \phi_1^{-1} -J) \nabla I|_{\phi_1^{-1}} (- D \phi_1)_{|\phi_1^{-1}}^{-1}(D \phi_1)_{|\phi_1^{-1}}) \int_0^1 (D \phi_t)_{|\phi_1^{-1}}^{-1} (\delta v_t)_{|{\phi_t \circ \phi_1^{-1}}} dt dx

==LDDMM Diffusion Tensor Image Matching==
LDDMM matching based on the principal eigenvector of the diffusion tensor matrix
takes the image &lt;math&gt; I(x), x \in {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt; as a unit vector field defined by the first eigenvector.
&lt;ref name="Cao 1379–1386 Vol. 2"/&gt;
The group action becomes
:&lt;math&gt;
\varphi \cdot I=
\begin{cases}
\frac{D_{\varphi^{-1}} \varphi I \circ \varphi^{-1} \|I \circ \varphi^{-1}\|}{\|D_{\varphi^{-1}} \varphi I \circ \varphi^{-1}\|} &amp; I\circ \varphi \neq 0, \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \|\cdot \|&lt;/math&gt; that denotes image squared-error norm.

==LDDMM ODF==
High angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) addresses the well-known limitation of DTI, that is, DTI can only reveal one dominant fiber orientation at each location. HARDI measures diffusion along &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; uniformly distributed directions on the sphere and can characterize more complex fiber geometries by reconstructing an orientation distribution function (ODF) that characterizes the angular profile of the diffusion probability density function of water molecules. The ODF is a function defined on a unit sphere, &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb{S}}^2 &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Du|first1=J|last2=Goh|first2=A|last3=Qiu|first3=A|title=Diffeomorphic metric mapping of high angular resolution diffusion imaging based on Riemannian structure of orientation distribution functions|journal=IEEE Trans Med Imaging|date=2012|volume=31|issue=5|pages=1021–1033|doi=10.1109/TMI.2011.2178253|pmid=22156979}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Denote the square-root ODF (&lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{\text{ODF}}} &lt;/math&gt;) as &lt;math&gt; \psi({\bf s}) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \psi({\bf s}) &lt;/math&gt; is non-negative to ensure uniqueness and &lt;math&gt; \int_{{\bf s}\in  {\mathbb{S}}^2} \psi^2({\bf s}) d{\bf s}=1&lt;/math&gt;. The metric defines the distance between two &lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{\text{ODF}}} &lt;/math&gt; functions &lt;math&gt; \psi_1, \psi_2 \in \Psi &lt;/math&gt; as 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\rho(\psi_1,\psi_2)=
\|\log_{\psi_1}(\psi_2)\|_{\psi_1} 
=\cos^{-1} \langle \psi_1, \psi_2 \rangle=
\cos^{-1}\left(\int_{{\bf s}\in {\mathbb{S}}^2} \psi_1({\bf s}) \psi_2({\bf s})d{\bf s}\right),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is the normal dot product between points in the sphere under the &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{L}^2 &lt;/math&gt; metric.
The template and target are denoted
&lt;math&gt; \psi_{\mathrm{temp}}({\bf s},x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\psi_{\mathrm{targ}}({\bf s}, x)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt; {\bf s} \in {{\mathbb{S}}^2} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; x \in X &lt;/math&gt; indexed across the unit sphere and the image domain, with the target indexed similarly.

Define the variational problem assuming that two ODF volumes can be generated from one to another via flows of diffeomorphisms &lt;math&gt; \phi_t &lt;/math&gt;, which are solutions of ordinary differential equations 
&lt;math&gt; \dot \phi_t=v_t (\phi_t), t \in [0,1],\phi_0={id}&lt;/math&gt;. 
The group action of the diffeomorphism on the template is given according to  
&lt;math&gt;\phi_1 \cdot \psi (x)\doteq  (D\phi_1) \psi \circ \phi_1^{-1}(x), x \in X &lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt; (D\phi_1) &lt;/math&gt; is the Jacobian of the affined transformed ODF and is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(D \phi_1) \psi\circ \phi_1^{-1}(x)=\sqrt{\frac{\det{\bigl(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1}} }{\left\|{\bigl(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1} } {\bf s} \right\|^3} } \quad
\psi \left( \frac{(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1} {\bf s}}{\|(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1} {\bf s}\|}, \phi_1^{-1}(x) \right) .
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The LDDMM variational problem is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\min_{v: \dot \phi_t=
v_t \circ \phi_t,\phi_0={
id}}\int_0^1 \int_{R^3} Av_t \cdot v_t dx \ dt 
 +\lambda \int_{R^3}\|\log_{(D\phi_1) \psi_{\mathrm{temp}} \circ \phi_1^{-1}(x)}(\psi_{\mathrm{targ}}(x))\|^2_{(D\phi_1) \psi_{\mathrm{temp}}\circ \phi_1^{-1}(x)}dx 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Computational anatomy]] (CA) is the study of shape and form in [[medical imaging]]. The study of deformable shapes in [[computational anatomy]] rely on high-dimensional diffeomorphism groups &lt;math&gt; \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt; which generate orbits of the form &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M} \doteq
\{ \varphi \cdot m \mid \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V \} &lt;/math&gt;. In CA, this orbit is in general considered a smooth [[Riemannian manifold]]
since at every point of the manifold &lt;math&gt; m \in \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt; there is an  [[Inner product space|inner product]] inducing the norm &lt;math&gt; \| \cdot \|_m &lt;/math&gt; on the [[tangent space]]
that varies smoothly from point to point in the manifold of shapes &lt;math&gt; m \in \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt;. This is generated by viewing the
group of diffeomorphisms &lt;math&gt; \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt; as a Riemannian manifold with &lt;math&gt; \| \cdot \|_\varphi  &lt;/math&gt;,  associated to the tangent space at  &lt;math&gt; \varphi \in\operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt; . This induces the norm and metric on the orbit &lt;math&gt; m \in \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt; under the action from the group of diffeomorphisms.

==The diffeomorphisms group generated as Lagrangian and Eulerian flows==
The diffeomorphisms in [[computational anatomy]] are generated to satisfy the [[Computational anatomy#Lagrangian and Eulerian flows for generating diffeomorphisms|Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow fields]], &lt;math&gt; \varphi_t,  t \in [0,1] &lt;/math&gt;, generated via the ordinary differential equation

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt} \varphi_t = v_t \circ \varphi_t , \ \varphi_0 = \operatorname{id}; &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Lagrangian flow}}}}
with the Eulerian vector fields &lt;math&gt; v \doteq (v_1,v_2,v_3) &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;  {\mathbb R}^3   &lt;/math&gt;  for &lt;math&gt;v_t = \dot \varphi_t \circ \varphi_t^{-1}, t \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, with the inverse for the flow given by

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
 \frac{d}{dt} \varphi_t^{-1} = -(D \varphi_t^{-1}) v_t, \ \varphi_0^{-1} = \operatorname{id}, &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eulerianflow}}}}
and the &lt;math&gt;3 \times 3&lt;/math&gt; Jacobian matrix for flows in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;  given as &lt;math&gt; \ D\varphi \doteq \left(\frac{\partial \varphi_i}{\partial x_j}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

To ensure smooth flows of diffeomorphisms with inverse,  the vector fields &lt;math&gt;  {\mathbb R}^3   &lt;/math&gt; must be at least 1-time continuously differentiable in space&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;P. Dupuis, U. Grenander, M.I. Miller, Existence of Solutions on Flows of Diffeomorphisms, Quarterly of Applied Math, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;A. Trouvé.

&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Diffeomorphism Group}}}}

==The Riemannian orbit model==
Shapes in [[Computational anatomy|Computational Anatomy (CA)]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;are studied via the use of diffeomorphic mapping for establishing correspondences between anatomical coordinate systems. In this setting, 3-dimensional medical images are modelled as diffemorphic transformations of some exemplar, termed the template &lt;math&gt; I_{temp} &lt;/math&gt;, resulting in the observed images to be elements of the random [[Computational anatomy#The deformable template orbit model of CA|orbit model of CA]]. For images these are defined as &lt;math&gt; I \in \mathcal {I}
\doteq \{ I = I_{temp} \circ \varphi, \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V \} &lt;/math&gt;, with for charts representing sub-manifolds denoted as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} \doteq \{ \varphi \cdot m_{temp} : \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V \}&lt;/math&gt;.

==The Riemannian metric==
The orbit of shapes and forms in Computational Anatomy  are generated by the group action&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} \doteq \{ \varphi \cdot m : \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V \}&lt;/math&gt;.   This is made into a Riemannian orbit by introducing a metric associated to each point and associated tangent space. For this a metric is defined on the group which induces the metric on the orbit. Take as the metric for  [[Computational anatomy]] at each element of the tangent space &lt;math&gt;\varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V&lt;/math&gt; in the group of diffeomorphisms 
:&lt;math&gt; \| \dot \varphi \|_\varphi \doteq \| \dot \varphi \circ \varphi^{-1} \|_V=\| v \|_V &lt;/math&gt;, 
with the vector fields modelled to be in a Hilbert space with the norm in the Hilbert space &lt;math&gt;(V, \| \cdot \|_V )&lt;/math&gt;. We model &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; as a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) defined by a 1-1, differential operator&lt;math&gt; A: V \rightarrow V^*  &lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt; \sigma(v) \doteq Av \in V^*

The differential operator is selected so that the Green's kernel associated to the inverse is sufficiently smooth so that the [[Computational anatomy#The Smoothness Condition on Vector fields as Modelled in a Reproducing kernel Hilbert space|vector fields support 1-continuous derivative]].

===The right-invariant metric on diffeomorphisms===
The metric on the group of diffeomorphisms is defined by the distance as defined on pairs of elements in the group of diffeomorphisms according to

{{NumBlk||&lt;math&gt; d_{\operatorname{Diff}_V} (\psi, \varphi) = \inf_{v_t} \left(\frac 1 2 \int_0^1 \int_X Av_t \cdot v_t \,dx \  dt : \varphi_0 = \psi, \varphi_1 = \varphi, \dot \varphi_t = v_t \circ \varphi_t \right)^{1/2} \ .
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|metric-diffeomorphisms}}}}

This distance provides a right-invariant metric of diffeomorphometry,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=M.

==The Lie bracket in the group of diffeomorphisms==
The [[Lie bracket]] gives the adjustment of the velocity term resulting from a perturbation of the motion in the setting of curved spaces. Using [[Hamilton's principle]] of least-action derives the optimizing flows as a critical point for the action integral of the integral of the kinetic energy. The Lie bracket for vector fields in Computational Anatomy was first introduced in Miller, Trouve and Younes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MILLER|first=MICHAEL I.|last2=TROUVÉ|first2=ALAIN|last3=YOUNES|first3=LAURENT|date=2006-01-31|title=Geodesic Shooting for Computational Anatomy|journal=Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision|volume=24|issue=2|pages=209–228|doi=10.1007/s10851-005-3624-0|issn=0924-9907|pmc=2897162|pmid=20613972}}&lt;/ref&gt; The derivation calculates the perturbation &lt;math&gt; \delta v &lt;/math&gt; on the vector fields
&lt;math&gt; v^\varepsilon = v + \varepsilon \delta v &lt;/math&gt;   in terms of the derivative in time of the group perturbation  adjusted by the correction of the [[Lie bracket of vector fields]] in this function setting involving the Jacobian matrix, unlike the matrix group case:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; ad_v:V \mapsto V &lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt; ad_v(w)\doteq (Dv)w - (Dw)v ,   v,w \in V .&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|adjoint-Lie-bracket}}}}

'''Proof:'''
Proving [[Lie bracket of vector fields]] take a first order perturbation of the flow at point &lt;math&gt; \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt;.

Taking the first order perturbation gives &lt;math&gt; \varphi_t^\varepsilon \doteq 
(\operatorname{id} + \varepsilon w) \circ \varphi = \varphi+\varepsilon w \circ \varphi &lt;/math&gt;, with fixed boundary &lt;math&gt; w_0= w_1=0 &lt;/math&gt;, with  &lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dt} \varphi_t^\varepsilon = v_t^\varepsilon \circ \varphi_t^\varepsilon, \varphi_0^\varepsilon = \operatorname{id} , \varphi_1^\varepsilon = \varphi_1&lt;/math&gt;, giving the following two Eqns:  
:* &lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt} \varphi_t^\varepsilon = \frac{d}{dt} \varphi_t + \varepsilon \frac{d}{dt}(w_t \circ \varphi_t ) =v_t \circ \varphi_t + (D w_t)\circ \varphi_t v_t \circ \varphi_t +o(\varepsilon)\ .
&lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt; \dot \varphi_t^\varepsilon = (v_t + \varepsilon \delta v_t) \circ (\varphi_t + \varepsilon w_t \circ \varphi_t) \simeq v_t \circ \varphi_t +\varepsilon (Dv_t)\circ \varphi_t w_t \circ \varphi_t + \delta v_t \circ \varphi_t +o(\varepsilon) \ .
&lt;/math&gt;
Equating the above two equations gives the perturbation of the vector field in terms of the Lie bracket adjustment.
}}
The Lie bracket gives the first order variation of the vector field with respect to first order variation of the flow.
:&lt;math&gt; \delta v_t = \frac{d}{d t} w_t - ad_{v_t}(w_t) =\frac{d}{d t} w_t- ((Dv_t) w_t - (Dw_t)v_t) \ . &lt;/math&gt;

==The generalized Euler–Lagrange equation for the metric on diffeomorphic flows ==
{{Main|Computational anatomy|Computational anatomy#The Euler–Lagrange equation on shape momentum for geodesics on the group of diffeomorphisms}}
The Euler–Lagrange equation can be used to calculate geodesic flows through the group which form the basis for the metric. The [[Computational anatomy#The Action Integral for Hamilton's Principle on the Lagrangian Kinetic Energy|action integral for the Lagrangian of the kinetic energy]] for Hamilton's principle becomes 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
J(\varphi) \doteq \frac{1}{2}\int_0^1 \| \dot \varphi_t \|_{\varphi_t}^2 \,dt = \frac{1}{2}\int_0^1  \| \dot \varphi_t \circ \varphi_t^{-1} \|_V^2 \,dt =\frac{1}{2}\int_0^1  \int_X A (\dot \varphi_t \circ \varphi_t^{-1})\cdot (\dot \varphi_t \circ \varphi_t^{-1}) \, dx \,dt \ .
&lt;/math&gt; |{{EquationRef|Hamilton's Action Integral}}}}
The action integral in terms of the vector field corresponds to integrating the kinetic energy
:&lt;math&gt;
 J(v) \doteq \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 \| v_t \|_V^2 dt = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 \int_X Av_t \cdot v_t \,dx \ dt
\ .
&lt;/math&gt;
The shortest paths geodesic connections in the orbit are defined via [[Hamilton's principal of least action|Hamilton's Principle of least action]] requires first order variations of the solutions in the orbits of Computational Anatomy which are based on computing critical points on the metric length or energy of the path.

==Riemannian exponential for positioning==
In the [[Computational anatomy|random orbit model of Computational anatomy]], the entire flow is reduced to the initial condition which forms the coordinates encoding the diffeomorphism, as well as providing the means of positioning information in the orbit. This was first terms a geodesic positioning system in Miller, Trouve, and Younes.&lt;ref name="pmid24904924"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Michael I.|last2=Younes|first2=Laurent|last3=Trouvé|first3=Alain|date=2014-03-01|title=Diffeomorphometry and geodesic positioning systems for human anatomy|journal=Technology|volume=2|issue=1|pages=36–43|doi=10.1142/S2339547814500010|issn=2339-5478|pmc=4041578|pmid=24904924}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the initial condition &lt;math&gt; v_0 &lt;/math&gt; then geodesic positioning  with respect to the [[Computational anatomy#Diffeomorphometry and the metric space of shapes and forms|Riemannian metric]] of Computational anatomy solves for the flow of the Euler–Lagrange equation. Solving the geodesic from the initial condition &lt;math&gt; v_0 &lt;/math&gt; is termed the '''Riemannian-exponential,''' a mapping &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Exp}_{\operatorname{id}}(\cdot): V \to \operatorname{Diff}_V

The Riemannian exponential satisfies &lt;math&gt;

==The variation problem for matching or registering coordinate system information in computational anatomy==
{{Further information | Large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping}}
Matching information across coordinate systems is central to [[computational anatomy]]. Adding a matching term &lt;math&gt;E: \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V \rightarrow R^+&lt;/math&gt; to the action integral of Equation ({{EquationNote|Hamilton's action integral}})
which represents the target endpoint 
:&lt;math&gt;C(\varphi) \doteq \int_0^1 \int_X Av_t \cdot v_t \,dx \, dt + E(\varphi_1) \ .&lt;/math&gt;
The endpoint term adds a boundary condition for the Euler–Lagrange equation ({{EquationNote|EL-General}})
which gives the Euler equation with boundary term. Taking the variation gives
*Necessary geodesic condition:

Construction of a Cubinder by extrusion of a cylinder along the W axis by a unit distance.]]
In four-dimensional geometry, the '''cubinder''' (otherwise known as '''cubical cylinder''' or '''hypercylinder''') is one way to generalise the 3D cylinder to 4D. Like the [[duocylinder]] and [[spherinder]], it is also analogous to a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] in 3-space, which is the [[Cartesian product]] of a disk with a [[line segment]].

The Cubinder is the Cartesian Product of a circle and a square, and it is a rotachoron. It can be constructed by extrusion of a 3D [[cylinder]] along the W- axis by a unit distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agnijomaths.com/categories/geometry/Euclidean_geometry/four_dimensional_space.html|title=Four dimensional space|last=Banerjee|first=Agnijo|website=www.agnijomaths.com|access-date=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The net of a cubinder is given by a single [[cube]], surrounded by 4 cylinders.

The diagram is a perspective projection of the cubinder. The cubinder is rotated 45 degrees in the ZW plane. This allows us to observe that the cubinder is made up of four cylinders. However the square torus joining the cylinders cannot be observed from this perspective. 

== Relationship to other shapes ==
In 4-space, there are three intermediate forms between the [[tesseract]] (1 ball × 1 ball × 1 ball × 1 ball) and the [[hypersphere]] (4-ball). These are as follows:
* cubinder (2-ball × 1-ball × 1-ball)
* [[spherinder]] (3-ball × 1-ball)
* [[duocylinder]] (2-ball × 2-ball).

All five correspond to the [[integer partition]]s of the number of dimensions (4); it is easy to see that this also holds for lower dimensions.

The cubinder is also a rotatope (more specifically a '''rotachoron'''), along with other shapes such as the tesseract, duocylinder, spherinder, and [[glome]].  A rotachoron is a four dimensional shape which can by formed by extensions and rotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:List_of_protologisms/Q%E2%80%93Z#rotatope|title=Appendix:List of protologisms/Q–Z – Wiktionary|website=en.wiktionary.org|language=en|access-date=2017-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cubinder is a rotachoron as it can be formed via extension of a cylinder or rotation of a cube.

The rotation of cubinder to 5D is non-unique: rotating it around a cubic cross-section will lead to the shape, '''spherisquare'''. However, if you rotate it around its cylindrical cross-section, you will get a different rotatope called "'''dual cylinder'''", which can be also gotten by extending the duocylinder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hi.gher.space/forum/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=409&amp;start=0|title=Hi.gher.

In [[astronomy]], [[geography]], and related sciences and contexts, a ''[[Direction (geometry, geography)|direction]]'' or ''[[plane (geometry)|plane]]'' passing by a given point is said to be '''vertical''' if it contains the local [[gravity direction]] at that point.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last1 = Hofmann-Wellenhof |first1 = B.
|last2 = Moritz |first2 = H.
|title = Physical Geodesy

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Conversely, a direction or plane is said to be '''horizontal''' if it is perpendicular to the vertical direction.
In general, something that is vertical can be drawn from up to down (or down to up), such as the y-axis in the [[Cartesian coordinate system]].

==Historical definition==
[[Girard Desargues]] defined the vertical to be [[Horizon#Projective geometry|perpendicular to the horizon]] in his 1636 book ''Perspective''.

The word ''horizontal'' is derived from ''[[horizon]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED|horizontal}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas ''vertical'' originates in the late [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|verticalis}}'', which is from the same root as ''[[vertex (disambiguation)|vertex]]'', meaning "highest point".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED|vertical}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geophysical definition==
{{further|Gravity of Earth|Figure of Earth}}

===The plumb line and spirit level===
[[File:Bubble on a marble shelf.PNG|thumb|Spirit level bubble on a marble shelf tests for horizontality]]
In physics, engineering and construction, the direction designated as vertical is usually that along which a [[plumb-bob]] hangs. Alternatively, a [[spirit level]] that exploits the buoyancy of an air bubble and its tendency to go vertically upwards may be used to test for horizontality. Modern rotary laser levels that can level themselves automatically are robust sophisticated instruments and work on the same fundamental principle.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.laser-level.co.uk/products/stabila-rotary-lasers/stabila-lar200.html Laser Levels]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For how a spirit level works, see http://www.physicsforums.com/showthread.php?t=562730&lt;/ref&gt;

===The flat earth approximation===
In the flat earth scenario,&lt;ref&gt;See ''Theory and Problems of Theoretical Mechanics" by Murray R Spiegel, 1987, pg 62&lt;/ref&gt; where the earth is notionally a large (infinite) flat surface with gravitational field at a right angle to the surface, the earth surface is horizontal and any plane parallel to the earth surface is also horizontal.  Vertical planes, e.g., walls, may be parallel to each other or they may intersect at a vertical line. Horizontal surfaces do not intersect. Furthermore, a  plane cannot both be a horizontal plane at one place and a vertical plane somewhere else.
[[File:Vertical and Horizontal Lines.png|thumb|Vertical &amp; Horizontal Lines]]

===The spherical Earth===
[[File:Vertical wall are never parallel.PNG|thumb|Strictly, vertical walls are never parallel on the surface of a spherical planet]]
When the curvature of the earth is taken into account, the concepts of vertical and horizontal take on yet another meaning. On the surface of a smoothly spherical, homogenous, non-rotating planet, the plumb bob picks out as vertical the radial direction. Strictly speaking, it is now no longer possible for vertical walls to be parallel: ''all'' verticals intersect. This fact has real practical applications in construction and civil engineering, e.g., the tops of the towers of a suspension bridge are further apart than at the bottom. 
&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia.com. In very long bridges, it may be necessary to take the earth's curvature into account when designing the towers. For example, in the New York's Verrazano Narrows Bridge, the towers, which are 700 ft (215 m) tall and stand 4260 ft (298 m) apart, are about 1.75 in (4.5 cm) farther apart at the top than they are at the bottom.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Horizontal planes can intersect.PNG|thumbnail|On a spherical planet, horizontal planes intersect. In the example shown, the blue line represents the tangent plane at the North pole, the red the tangent plane at an equatorial point. The two intersect at a right angle.]]
Also, horizontal planes can intersect when they are [[tangent]] planes to separated points on the surface of the earth. In particular, a plane tangent to a point on the equator intersects the plane tangent to the [[North Pole]] at a [[right angle]]. (See diagram).
Furthermore, the [[equator]]ial plane is parallel to the tangent plane at the North Pole and as such has claim to be a horizontal plane. But it is. at the same time, a vertical plane for points on the equator. In this sense, a plane can, arguably, be ''both'' horizontal and vertical, horizontal ''at one place'', and vertical ''at another''.

=== Further complications===
{{Main Article|Vertical deflection}}
For a spinning earth, the plumb line deviates from the radial direction as a function of latitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://faculty.trinityvalleyschool.org/hoseltom/handouts/Chap%2014-Ax-Plumb-bob%20Deviation%20w%20Latitude-34PbyE.pdf|title= Working in the Rotating Reference Frame of the Earth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only at the North and South Poles does the plumb line align with the local radius. The situation is actually even more complicated because earth is not a [[homogeneous]] smooth sphere. It is a non homogeneous, non spherical, knobby planet in motion, and the vertical not only need not lie along a radial, it may even be curved and be varying with time. On a smaller scale, a mountain to one side may deflect the plumb bob away from the true [[zenith]].&lt;ref&gt;Such a deflection was measured by [[Nevil Maskelyne]]. See Maskelyne, N. (1775). "An Account of Observations Made on the Mountain Schiehallion for Finding Its Attraction". Phil. Trans. Royal Soc. 65 (0): 500–542. doi:10.1098/rstl.1775.0050. [[Charles Hutton]] used the observed value to determine the density of the earth.&lt;/ref&gt;

On a larger scale the gravitational field of the earth, which is at least approximately radial near the earth, is not radial when it is affected by the moon at higher altitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Walls and floors ===
[[File:Brick wall close-up view.jpg|thumb|Brick wall showing horizontal mortar courses and vertical perpendiculars. By contrast, a level floor only contains horizontal lines.]] 
On a (horizontal) floor, one can draw a horizontal line but not a vertical line in the sense of a plumb bob line. But on a (vertical) wall, one can draw both vertical ''and'' horizontal lines. In this sense, a vertical wall allows more options. This is reflected in the tools a bricklayer uses: a plumb line for verticality and a spirit level to check that the mortar courses are horizontal.
On the other hand, in contrast to a wall a horizontal floor allows more options when one considers compass directions. One can draw on a floor lines going north, south, east, and west, in fact, along any compass direction. A wall allows fewer options. For instance, on a wall which runs along a longitude, an insect cannot crawl east.{{who|date=March 2020}}

=== Independence of horizontal and vertical motions ===
Neglecting the curvature of the earth, horizontal and vertical motions of a projectile moving under gravity are independent of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Salters Hornerns Advanced Physics Project, As Student Book, Edexcel Pearson, London,  2008, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Vertical displacement of a projectile is not affected by the horizontal component of the launch velocity, and, conversely, the horizontal displacement is unaffected by the vertical component.  The notion dates at least as far back as Galileo.&lt;ref&gt;See Galileo's discussion of how bodies rise and fall under gravity on a moving ship in his ''Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems''(trans. S. Drake). University of California Press, Berkeley, 1967, pp. 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the curvature of the earth is taken into account, the independence of the two motion does ''not'' hold. For example, even a projectile fired in a horizontal direction (i.e., with a zero vertical component) may leave the surface of the spherical earth and indeed escape altogether.&lt;ref&gt;See Harris Benson ''University Physics'', New York 1991, page 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical definition==

===In two dimensions===
[[File:Vertical horizontal.PNG|thumb|In two dimensions. 1. The vertical direction is designated. 2. The horizontal is perpendicular to the vertical. Through any point P, there is exactly one vertical and exactly one horizontal. Alternatively, one can start by designating the horizontal direction.]]

In the context of a 1-dimensional orthogonal [[Cartesian coordinate system]] on  a Euclidean plane, to say that a line is horizontal or vertical, an initial designation has to be made. One can start off by designating the vertical direction, usually labelled  the Y direction.&lt;ref&gt;For an example of identification of the ''y''-axis with the vertical, and the ''x''-axis with the horizontal, see G.S.Rehill's ''Interactive Maths Series, "Building a Strong foundation in Mathematics"'', accessible on http://www.mathsteacher.com.au/year8/ch15_graphs/05_hor/ver.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; The horizontal direction, usually labelled the X direction,&lt;ref&gt;For a definition of "Horizontal axis" see Math Dictionary at http://www.icoachmath.com/math_dictionary/Horizontal_Axis.html&lt;/ref&gt; is then automatically determined. Or, one can do it the other way around, i.e., nominate the ''x''-axis, in which case the ''y''-axis is then automatically determined. There is no special reason to choose the horizontal over the vertical as the initial designation: the two directions are on par in this respect.

The following hold in the two-dimensional case:
# Through any point P in the plane, there is one and only one ''vertical line'' within the plane and one and only one ''horizontal line'' within the plane. This symmetry breaks down as one moves to the three-dimensional case.
# A  ''vertical line'' is any line parallel to the vertical direction. A ''horizontal line'' is any line normal to a vertical line.
# Horizontal lines do not cross each other.
#Vertical lines do not cross each other.

Not all of these elementary geometric facts are true in the 3-D context.

===In three dimensions===
In the three-dimensional case, the situation is more complicated as now one has horizontal and vertical planes in addition to horizontal and vertical lines. Consider a point P and designate a direction through P as vertical. A plane which contains P and is normal to the designated direction is the ''[[horizontal plane]]'' at P. Any plane going through P, normal to the horizontal plane is a  ''[[vertical plane]]'' at P. Through any point P, there is one and only one horizontal plane but a ''multiplicity'' of vertical planes. This is a new feature that emerges in three dimensions. The symmetry that exists in the two-dimensional case no longer holds.

=== In the classroom===
[[File:Mystery of the horizontal y-axis.PNG|thumb|The ''y''-axis on the wall is vertical but the one on the table is horizontal]]
In the 2-dimension case, as mentioned already, the usual designation of the vertical coincides with the [[y-axis]] in co-ordinate geometry. This convention can cause confusion in the classroom. For the teacher, writing perhaps on a white board, the ''y''-axis really is  vertical in the sense of the plumbline verticality but for the student the axis may well lie on a horizontal table.

==Discussion==
{{cleanup merge|Horizontal plane}}
{{essay-like|section|date=July 2018}}
[[File:Bubble on a marble shelf.PNG|thumb|A spirit level on a shelf]]

Although the word horizontal is commonly used in daily life and language (see below), it is subject to many misconceptions.

* The concept of horizontality only makes sense in the context of a clearly measurable gravity field, i.e., in the 'neighborhood' of a planet, star, etc. When the gravity field becomes very weak (the masses are too small or too distant from the point of interest), the notion of being horizontal loses its meaning.
[[File:Verticals at separate points.PNG|thumb|left|Verticals at two separate points are not parallel. The same holds for their associated horizontal planes]]
* A plane is horizontal only at the chosen point. Horizontal planes at two separate points are not parallel, they intersect.
* In general, a horizontal plane will only be perpendicular to a [[vertical direction]] if both are specifically defined with respect to the same point: a direction is only vertical at the point of reference. Thus both horizontality and verticality are strictly speaking local concepts, and it is always necessary to state to which location the direction or the plane refers to. Note that (1) the same restriction applies to the straight lines contained within the plane: they are horizontal only at the point of reference, and (2) those straight lines contained in the plane but not passing by the reference point are not necessarily horizontal anywhere.
[[File:Gravitational field due to knobbly planet.PNG|thumb|field lines for a non homogeneous knobbly planet in motion may be curved. The white, red and hlue bits illustrate the planet's heterogeneity.]]
* In reality, the gravity field of a heterogeneous planet such as [[Earth]] is deformed due to the inhomogeneous spatial distribution of materials with different [[density|densities]]. Actual horizontal planes are thus not even parallel even if their reference points are along the same vertical line, since a vertical line is slightly curved.
* At any given location, the total gravitational force is not quite constant over [[time]], because the objects that generate the gravity are moving. For instance, on Earth the horizontal plane at a given point (as determined by a pair of [[spirit level]]s) changes with the position of the Moon (air, sea and land [[tide]]s).
* On a rotating planet such as Earth, the strictly gravitational pull of the planet (and other celestial objects such as the Moon, the [[Sun]], etc.) is different from the apparent net force (e.g., on a free-falling object) that can be measured in the laboratory or in the field. This difference is the [[centrifugal force (fictitious)|centrifugal force]] associated with the planet's rotation. This is a [[fictitious force]]: it only arises when calculations or experiments are conducted in [[Inertial frame of reference|non-inertial frames of reference]], such as the surface of the Earth.

In general or in practice, something that is horizontal can be [[Drawing|drawn]] from left to right (or right to left), such as the x-axis in the [[Cartesian coordinate system]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

===Practical use in daily life===
[[File:Mystery of the horizontal y-axis.PNG|thumb|The y-axis on the wall is vertical but the one on the table is horizontal.]]
The concept of a horizontal plane is thus anything but simple, although, in practice, most of these effects and variations are rather small: they are measurable and can be predicted with great accuracy, but they may not greatly affect our daily life.

This dichotomy between the apparent simplicity of a concept and an actual complexity of defining (and measuring) it in scientific terms arises from the fact that the typical linear scales and dimensions of relevance in daily life are 3 [[orders of magnitude]] (or more) smaller than the size of the Earth. Hence, the world appears to be flat locally, and horizontal planes in nearby locations appear to be parallel. Such statements are nevertheless approximations; whether they are acceptable in any particular context or application depends on the applicable requirements, in particular in terms of accuracy.
In graphical contexts, such as [[Technical drawing|drawing and drafting]] and Co-ordinate geometry on rectangular paper, it is very common to associate one of the dimensions of the paper with a horizontal, even though the entire sheet of paper is standing on a flat horizontal (or slanted) table. In this case, the horizontal direction is typically from the left side of the paper to the right side. This is purely conventional (although it is somehow 'natural' when drawing a natural scene as it is seen in reality), and may lead to misunderstandings or misconceptions, especially in an educational context.

A '''geometry template''' is a piece of clear plastic with cut-out shapes for use in [[mathematics]] and other subjects in [[primary school]] through [[secondary school]].  It also has various measurements on its sides to be used like a [[ruler]]. In Australia, popular brands include Mathomat and MathAid.

==Brands==
===Mathomat and Mathaid===
Mathomat is a trademark used for a plastic stencil developed in Australia by Craig Young in 1969, who originally worked as an engineering tradesperson in the [[Government Aircraft Factories]] (GAF) in Melbourne before retraining and working as head of mathematics in a secondary school in Melbourne. Young designed Mathomat to address what he perceived as limitations of traditional mathematics drawing sets in classrooms, mainly caused by students losing parts of the sets. The Mathomat stencil has a large number of geometric shapes stencils combined with the functions of a [[Technical drawing tool|technical drawing set]] (rulers, set squares, protractor and circles stencils to replace a compass). 

The template made use [[polycarbonate]] – a new type of thermoplastic polymer when Mathomat first came out – which was strong and transparent enough to allow for a large number of stencil shapes to be included in its design without breaking or tearing. The first template was exhibited in 1970 at a mathematics conference in Melbourne along with a series of popular mathematics teaching lesson plan; it became an immediate success with a large number of schools specifying it as a required students purchase. As of 2017, the stencil is widely specified in Australian schools, chiefly for students at early secondary school level. The manufacturing of Mathomat was taken over in 1989 by the W&amp;G drawing instrument company, which had a factory in Melbourne for manufacture of technical drawing instruments. Young also developed MathAid, which was initially produced by him when he was living in [[Ringwood, Victoria]]. He later sold the company.

W&amp;G published a series of teacher resource books for Mathomat authored by various teachers and academics who were interested in Mathomat as a teaching product.

==Formal definition==

===Acylindrical action===

Let ''G'' be a group with an isometric action on some geodesic [[hyperbolic metric space]] ''X''. This action is called '''acylindrical'''&lt;ref name=Osin/&gt; if for every &lt;math&gt;R\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; there exist &lt;math&gt; N&gt;0, L&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that for every &lt;math&gt;x,y\in X&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)\ge L&lt;/math&gt; one has
:&lt;math&gt;\# \{g\in G\mid d(x,gx)\le R, d(y,gy)\le R)\} \le N.   &lt;/math&gt;

If the above property holds for a specific &lt;math&gt;R\ge 0&lt;/math&gt;, the action of ''G'' on ''X'' is called ''R''-'''acylindrical'''.  The notion of acylindricity provides a suitable substitute for being a [[proper action]] in the more general context where non-proper actions are allowed. 

An acylindrical isometric action of a group ''G'' on a geodesic [[hyperbolic metric space]] ''X'' is '''non-elementary''' if '''G''' admits two independent [[Hyperbolic_metric_space#The_action_of_isometries_on_the_boundary_and_their_classification|hyperbolic]] isometries of ''X'', that is, two loxodromic elements &lt;math&gt;g,h\in G&lt;/math&gt; such that their fixed point sets &lt;math&gt;\{g^+,g^-\}\subseteq \partial X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{h^+,h^-\}\subseteq \partial X&lt;/math&gt; are disjoint. 

It is known (Theorem 1.1 in &lt;ref name=Osin/&gt;) that an acylindrical action of a group ''G'' on a geodesic hyperbolic metric space ''X'' is non-elementary if and only if this action has unbounded orbits in ''X'' and the group ''G'' is not a finite extension of a cyclic group generated by loxodromic isometry of&amp;nbsp;''X''.

===Acylindrically hyperbolic group===

A group ''G'' is called '''acylindrically hyperbolic''' if ''G'' admits a non-elementary acylindrical isometric action on some geodesic hyperbolic metric space&amp;nbsp;''X''.

==Equivalent characterizations== 

It is known (Theorem 1.2 in &lt;ref name=Osin/&gt;) that for a group ''G'' the following conditions are equivalent:

*The group ''G'' is acylindrically hyperbolic.
*There exists a (possibly infinite) generating set ''S'' for ''G'', such that the [[Cayley graph]] &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(G,S)&lt;/math&gt; is hyperbolic, and the natural translation action of ''G'' on &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(G,S)&lt;/math&gt; is a non-elementary acylindrical action.
*The group ''G'' is not [[virtually cyclic group|virtually cyclic]], and there exists an isometric action of ''G'' on a geodesic hyperbolic metric space ''X'' such that at least one element of ''G'' acts on ''X'' with the WPD ('Weakly Properly Discontinuous') property.
*The group ''G'' contains a proper infinite 'hyperbolically embedded' [[subgroup]].&lt;ref name=DGO&gt;{{cite book |first=F. |last=Dahmani |first2=V. |last2=Guirardel |first3=D. |last3=Osin |title=Hyperbolically embedded subgroups and rotating families in groups acting on hyperbolic spaces |publisher=American Mathematical Society |year=2017 |isbn=978-1-4704-2194-6 |series=[[Memoirs of the American Mathematical Society]] |volume=245 |id=1156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diffeomorphometry''' is the metric study of imagery, shape and form in the discipline of [[computational anatomy]] (CA) in [[medical imaging]]. The study of images in [[computational anatomy]] rely on high-dimensional [[diffeomorphism]] [[Group (mathematics)|groups]] &lt;math&gt; \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt; which generate orbits of the form  &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{I} \doteq

\{ \varphi \cdot I \mid \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V \} &lt;/math&gt;, in which images &lt;math&gt; I \in \mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt; can be dense scalar [[Magnetic resonance imaging|magnetic resonance]] or [[computed axial tomography]] images. For [[Deformable bodies|deformable shapes]] these are the collection of [[manifold]]s &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M} \doteq

\{ \varphi \cdot M \mid \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V \} &lt;/math&gt;,  points, [[Differential geometry of curves|curves]] and [[Surface (mathematics)|surface]]s. The diffeomorphisms move the images and shapes through the orbit according to &lt;math&gt;(\varphi,I)\mapsto \varphi \cdot I&lt;/math&gt; which are defined as the [[Group actions in computational anatomy|group actions of computational anatomy]].

The orbit of shapes and forms  is made into a metric space by inducing a metric on the group of diffeomorphisms.  &lt;nowiki/&gt;The study of metrics on groups of diffeomorphisms and the study of metrics between manifolds and surfaces has been an area of significant investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=M.

Informally, the [[Metric space|metric]]  is constructed by defining a flow of diffemorphisms &lt;math&gt;\dot \phi_t , t \in [0,1], \phi_t \in \operatorname{Diff}_V&lt;/math&gt; which connect the group elements from one to another, so for &lt;math&gt; \varphi,\psi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\phi_0 = \varphi , \phi_1=\psi&lt;/math&gt;.  The metric between two coordinate systems or diffeomorphisms is then the shortest length or [[Geodesic|geodesic flow]] connecting them. The metric on the space associated to the geodesics is given by&lt;math&gt;\rho(\varphi,\psi) = \inf_{\phi: \phi_0=\varphi,\phi_1 = \psi} \int_0^1 \| \dot \phi_t \|_{\phi_t} \, dt&lt;/math&gt;. The metrics on the orbits &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I},\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;  are inherited from the metric induced on the diffeomorphism group.&lt;nowiki/&gt;

The group &lt;math&gt; \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt; is thusly made into a smooth [[Riemannian manifold]] with Riemannian metric &lt;math&gt; \| \cdot \|_\varphi  &lt;/math&gt;  associated to the tangent spaces at all &lt;math&gt; \varphi \in\operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt;. The  &lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Riemannian metric]] satisfies at every point of the manifold &lt;math&gt; \phi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt; there is an  [[Inner product space|inner product]] inducing the norm  on the [[tangent space]] &lt;math&gt; \| \dot \phi_t  \|_{\phi_t} &lt;/math&gt;  that varies smoothly across &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt;.

Oftentimes, the familiar [[Euclidean distance|Euclidean metric]] is not directly applicable because the patterns of shapes and images don't form a [[vector space]]. In the [[Riemannian Metric and Lie-Bracket Interpretation of the Euler Equation on Geodesics|Riemannian orbit model of Computational anatomy]], diffeomorphisms acting on the forms &lt;math&gt;\varphi \cdot I \in \mathcal {I}, \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V, M \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; don't act linearly. There are many ways to define metrics, and for the sets associated to shapes the [[Hausdorff metric]] is another. The method used to induce the [[Riemannian metric]] is to induce the metric on the orbit of shapes by defining it in terms of the metric length between diffeomorphic coordinate system transformations of the flows. Measuring the lengths of the geodesic flow between coordinates systems in the orbit of shapes is called '''diffeomorphometry'''.

&lt;math&gt;
 \frac{d}{dt} \varphi_t^{-1} = -(D \varphi_t^{-1}) v_t, \ \varphi_0^{-1} = \operatorname{id}, &lt;/math&gt;

==The Riemannian orbit model==

Shapes in [[Computational anatomy|Computational Anatomy (CA)]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;are studied via the use of diffeomorphic mapping for establishing correspondences between anatomical coordinate systems. In this setting, 3-dimensional medical images are modelled as diffemorphic transformations of some exemplar, termed the template &lt;math&gt; I_{temp} &lt;/math&gt;, resulting in the observed images to be elements of the random [[Computational anatomy#The deformable template orbit model of CA|orbit model of CA]]. For images these are defined as &lt;math&gt; I \in \mathcal {I}

\doteq \{ I = I_{temp} \circ \varphi, \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V \} &lt;/math&gt;, with for charts representing sub-manifolds denoted as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} \doteq \{ \varphi \cdot M_{temp} : \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V \}&lt;/math&gt;.

===The Riemannian metric===

The orbit of shapes and forms in Computational Anatomy  are generated by the group action &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \doteq \{ \varphi \cdot I : \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V \}&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} \doteq \{ \varphi \cdot M : \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V \}&lt;/math&gt;.   These are made into a Riemannian orbits by introducing a metric associated to each point and associated tangent space. For this a metric is defined on the group which induces the metric on the orbit. Take as the metric for [[Computational anatomy]] at each element of the tangent space &lt;math&gt;\varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V&lt;/math&gt; in the group of diffeomorphisms

:&lt;math&gt; \| \dot \varphi \|_\varphi \doteq \| \dot \varphi \circ \varphi^{-1} \|_V=\| v \|_V, &lt;/math&gt;

with the vector fields modelled to be in a Hilbert space with the norm in the [[Hilbert space]] &lt;math&gt;(V, \| \cdot \|_V )&lt;/math&gt;. We model &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; as a [[Reproducing kernel Hilbert space|reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS)]] defined by a 1-1, differential operator &lt;math&gt; A: V \rightarrow V^*  &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; V^*  &lt;/math&gt; is the dual-space. In general,   &lt;math&gt; \sigma \doteq Av \in V^* &lt;/math&gt; is a generalized function or distribution, the linear form  associated to the inner-product and norm for generalized functions are interpreted by integration by parts according to for &lt;math&gt;v,w \in V&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \langle v , w \rangle_V \doteq \int_X A v \cdot w \, dx, \ \| v\|_V^2 \doteq \int_X A v \cdot v \, dx, \ v,w \in V \ .
&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt; Av \doteq \mu \,dx &lt;/math&gt;, a vector density, &lt;math&gt;\int Av \cdot v \,dx \doteq \int \mu \cdot v \, dx = \sum_{i=1}^3 \mu_i v_i \, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

The differential operator is selected so that the [[Green's function|Green's kernel]] associated to the inverse is sufficiently smooth so that the [[Computational anatomy#The Smoothness Condition on Vector fields as Modelled in a Reproducing kernel Hilbert space|vector fields support 1-continuous derivative]]. The [[Sobolev embedding]] theorem arguments were made in demonstrating that 1-continuous derivative is required for smooth flows. The [[Green's function for the three-variable Laplace equation|Green's]] operator generated from the [[Green's function]](scalar case) associated to the differential operator smooths.

For proper choice of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; (V,\| \cdot \|_V) &lt;/math&gt; is an RKHS with the operator &lt;math&gt; K = A^{-1}: V^* \rightarrow V &lt;/math&gt;.  The Green's kernels associated to the differential operator smooths since for controlling enough derivatives in the square-integral sense the kernel  &lt;math&gt; k(\cdot,\cdot)

&lt;/math&gt; is continuously differentiable in both variables implying

:&lt;math&gt; K Av (x)_i \doteq \sum_j \int_{{\mathbb R}^3}  k_{ij}(x,y) Av_j(y) \,dy \in V \ .
&lt;/math&gt;

== The diffeomorphometry of the space of shapes and forms ==

===The right-invariant metric on diffeomorphisms===

The metric on the group of diffeomorphisms is defined by the distance as defined on pairs of elements in the group of diffeomorphisms according to
: {{NumBlk||&lt;math&gt;
d_{\mathrm{Diff}_V}(\psi, \varphi) = \inf_{v_t} \left(\int_0^1 \int_X Av_t \cdot v_t \, dx \, dt: \phi_0 = \psi, \phi_1 = \varphi, \dot \phi_t = v_t \circ \phi_t \right)^{1/2} \ .

'''Space''' is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which [[Physical body|objects]] and events have relative [[position (geometry)|position]] and [[direction (geometry)|direction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9068962/space|title=Space – Physics and Metaphysics|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=28 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506121655/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9068962/space|archive-date=6 May 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical space is often conceived in three [[linear]] [[dimension]]s, although modern [[physics|physicists]] usually consider it, with [[time]], to be part of a boundless four-dimensional [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]] known as [[spacetime]]. The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical [[universe]]. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a [[conceptual framework]].

Debates concerning the nature, essence and the mode of existence of space date back to antiquity; namely, to treatises like the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' of [[Plato]], or [[Socrates]] in his reflections on what the Greeks called ''[[khôra]]'' (i.e. "space"), or in the ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' of [[Aristotle]] (Book IV, Delta) in the definition of ''topos'' (i.e. place), or in the later "geometrical conception of place" as "space ''qua'' extension" in the ''Discourse on Place'' (''Qawl fi al-Makan'') of the 11th-century Arab polymath [[Alhazen]].&lt;ref&gt;Refer to Plato's ''Timaeus'' in the Loeb Classical Library, [[Harvard University]], and to his reflections on ''khora''. See also Aristotle's ''Physics'', Book IV, Chapter 5, on the definition of ''topos''. Concerning Ibn al-Haytham's 11th century conception of "geometrical place" as "spatial extension", which is akin to [[Descartes]]' and Leibniz's 17th century notions of ''extensio'' and ''analysis situs'', and his own mathematical refutation of Aristotle's definition of ''topos'' in natural philosophy, refer to: [[Nader El-Bizri]], "In Defence of the Sovereignty of Philosophy: al-Baghdadi's Critique of Ibn al-Haytham's Geometrisation of Place", ''Arabic Sciences and Philosophy'' ([[Cambridge University Press]]), Vol. 17 (2007), pp. 57–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these classical philosophical questions were discussed in the [[Renaissance]] and then reformulated in the 17th century, particularly during the early development of [[classical mechanics]]. In [[Isaac Newton]]'s view, space was absolute—in the sense that it existed permanently and independently of whether there was any matter in the space.&lt;ref&gt;French, A.J.; Ebison, M.G. (1986). ''Introduction to Classical Mechanics''. Dordrecht: Springer, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[natural philosopher]]s, notably [[Gottfried Leibniz]], thought instead that space was in fact a collection of relations between objects, given by their [[distance]] and [[direction (geometry)|direction]] from one another. In the 18th century, the philosopher and theologian [[George Berkeley]] attempted to refute the "visibility of spatial depth" in his ''Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision''. Later, the [[metaphysic]]ian [[Immanuel Kant]] said that the concepts of space and time are not empirical ones derived from experiences of the outside world—they are elements of an already given systematic framework that humans possess and use to structure all experiences. Kant referred to the experience of "space" in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' as being a subjective "pure ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' form of intuition".

In the 19th and 20th centuries mathematicians began to examine geometries that are [[Non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]], in which space is conceived as ''curved'', rather than ''flat''. According to [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]], space around [[gravitational field]]s deviates from Euclidean space.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap, R. (1995). ''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science''. New York: Dove. (Original edition: ''Philosophical Foundations of Physics''. New York: Basic books, 1966).&lt;/ref&gt; Experimental [[tests of general relativity]] have confirmed that non-Euclidean geometries provide a better model for the shape of space.

== Philosophy of space ==

=== Galileo ===
[[Galileo Galilei|Galilean]] and [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] theories about space, matter, and motion are at the foundation of the [[Scientific Revolution]], which is understood to have culminated with the publication of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s ''[[Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' in 1687.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Space from Zeno to Einstein : classic readings with a contemporary commentary|date=1999|publisher=MIT Press|others=Huggett, Nick.|isbn=978-0-585-05570-1|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=42855123|bibcode = 1999sze..book.....H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton's theories about space and time helped him explain the movement of objects. While his theory of space is considered the most influential in Physics, it emerged from his predecessors' ideas about the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janiak|first=Andrew|year=2015|title=Space and Motion in Nature and Scripture: Galileo, Descartes, Newton|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science|volume=51|pages=89–99|pmid=26227236|doi=10.1016/j.shpsa.2015.02.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As one of the pioneers of [[modern science]], Galileo revised the established [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] ideas about a [[Geocentric model|geocentric]] cosmos. He backed the [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] theory that the universe was [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]], with a stationary sun at the center and the planets—including the Earth—revolving around the sun. If the Earth moved, the Aristotelian belief that its natural tendency was to remain at rest was in question. Galileo wanted to prove instead that the sun moved around its axis, that motion was as natural to an object as the state of rest. In other words, for Galileo, celestial bodies, including the Earth, were naturally inclined to move in circles. This view displaced another Aristotelian idea—that all objects gravitated towards their designated natural place-of-belonging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Time and space|last=1958–|first=Dainton, Barry|date=2001|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|isbn=978-0-7735-2302-9|location=Montreal|oclc=47691120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== René Descartes ===
[[René Descartes|Descartes]] set out to replace the Aristotelian worldview with a theory about space and motion as determined by [[natural law]]s. In other words, he sought a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] foundation or a [[Mechanics|mechanical]] explanation for his theories about matter and motion. [[Cartesian space]] was [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] in structure—infinite, uniform and flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Time and Space|last=Dainton|first=Barry|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|year=2014|pages=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was defined as that which contained matter; conversely, matter by definition had a spatial extension so that there was no such thing as empty space.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Cartesian notion of space is closely linked to his theories about the nature of the body, mind and matter.  He is famously known for his "cogito ergo sum" (I think therefore I am), or the idea that we can only be certain of the fact that we can doubt, and therefore think and therefore exist. His theories belong to the [[Rationalism|rationalist]] tradition, which attributes knowledge about the world to our ability to think rather than to our experiences, as the [[Empiricism|empiricists]] believe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Descartes : a very short introduction|last=Tom.|first=Sorell|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-154036-3|location=Oxford|oclc=428970574}}&lt;/ref&gt; He posited a clear distinction between the body and mind, which is referred to as the [[Mind–body dualism|Cartesian dualism]].

=== Leibniz and Newton ===
[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|[[Gottfried Leibniz]]|upright|thumb]]
Following Galileo and Descartes, during the seventeenth century the [[philosophy of space and time]] revolved around the ideas of [[Gottfried Leibniz]], a German philosopher–mathematician, and [[Isaac Newton]], who set out two opposing theories of what space is. Rather than being an entity that independently exists over and above other matter, Leibniz held that space is no more than the collection of spatial relations between objects in the world: "space is that which results from places taken together".&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz, Fifth letter to Samuel Clarke. By H.G. Alexander (1956). ''The Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence''. Manchester: Manchester University Press, pp. 55–96.&lt;/ref&gt; Unoccupied regions are those that ''could'' have objects in them, and thus spatial relations with other places. For Leibniz, then, space was an idealised [[abstraction]] from the relations between individual entities or their possible locations and therefore could not be [[continuous probability distribution|continuous]] but must be [[discrete probability distribution|discrete]].&lt;ref&gt;Vailati, E. (1997). ''Leibniz &amp; Clarke: A Study of Their Correspondence''. New York: Oxford University Press, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;
Space could be thought of in a similar way to the relations between family members. Although people in the family are related to one another, the relations do not exist independently of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Sklar, L. (1992). ''Philosophy of Physics''. Boulder: Westview Press, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;
Leibniz argued that space could not exist independently of objects in the world because that implies a difference between two universes exactly alike except for the location of the material world in each universe. But since there would be no observational way of telling these universes apart then, according to the [[identity of indiscernibles]], there would be no real difference between them. According to the [[principle of sufficient reason]], any theory of space that implied that there could be these two possible universes must therefore be wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Sklar, L. ''Philosophy of Physics''. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|[[Isaac Newton]]|upright|thumb]]
Newton took space to be more than relations between material objects and based his position on [[observation]] and experimentation. For a [[Relational theory|relationist]] there can be no real difference between [[inertial frame of reference|inertial motion]], in which the object travels with constant [[velocity]], and [[non-inertial reference frame|non-inertial motion]], in which the velocity changes with time, since all spatial measurements are relative to other objects and their motions. But Newton argued that since non-inertial motion generates [[force]]s, it must be absolute.&lt;ref&gt;Sklar, L. ''Philosophy of Physics''. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; He used the example of [[Bucket argument|water in a spinning bucket]] to demonstrate his argument. Water in a [[bucket]] is hung from a rope and set to spin, starts with a flat surface. After a while, as the bucket continues to spin, the surface of the water becomes concave. If the bucket's spinning is stopped then the surface of the water remains concave as it continues to spin. The concave surface is therefore apparently not the result of relative motion between the bucket and the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Newton_bucket.html|title=Newton's bucket|work=st-and.ac.uk|access-date=20 July 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317062957/http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Newton_bucket.html|archive-date=17 March 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Newton argued, it must be a result of non-inertial motion relative to space itself. For several centuries the bucket argument was considered decisive in showing that space must exist independently of matter.

=== Kant ===
[[Image:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|upright|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]]]]
In the eighteenth century the German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] developed a theory of [[knowledge]] in which knowledge about space can be both ''a priori'' and ''[[analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap, R. ''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science''. pp. 177–178.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kant, knowledge about space is ''synthetic'', in that statements about space are not simply true by virtue of the meaning of the words in the statement. In his work, Kant rejected the view that space must be either a substance or relation. Instead he came to the conclusion that space and time are not discovered by humans to be objective features of the world, but imposed by us as part of a framework for organizing experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lucas |first=John Randolph |authorlink=John Lucas (philosopher) |title= Space, Time and Causality |page=149 |isbn=978-0-19-875057-4|year=1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-Euclidean geometry ===
{{main|Non-Euclidean geometry}}

[[Image:Sphere closed path.svg|thumb|150px|left|[[Spherical geometry]] is similar to [[elliptical geometry]]. On a [[sphere]] (the [[Surface (topology)|surface]] of a [[ball (mathematics)|ball]]) there are no [[parallel line]]s.]]Euclid's ''Elements'' contained five postulates that form the basis for Euclidean geometry. One of these, the [[parallel postulate]], has been the subject of debate among mathematicians for many centuries. It states that on any [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] on which there is a straight line ''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and a point ''P'' not on ''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', there is exactly one straight line ''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' on the plane that passes through the point ''P'' and is parallel to the straight line ''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''. Until the 19th century, few doubted the truth of the postulate; instead debate centered over whether it was necessary as an axiom, or whether it was a theory that could be derived from the other axioms.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap, R. ''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science''. p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1830 though, the Hungarian [[János Bolyai]] and the Russian [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky]] separately published treatises on a type of geometry that does not include the parallel postulate, called [[hyperbolic geometry]]. In this geometry, an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of parallel lines pass through the point ''P''. Consequently, the sum of angles in a triangle is less than 180° and the ratio of a [[circle]]'s [[circumference]] to its [[diameter]] is greater than [[pi]]. In the 1850s, [[Bernhard Riemann]] developed an equivalent theory of [[elliptical geometry]], in which no parallel lines pass through ''P''. In this geometry, triangles have more than 180° and circles have a ratio of circumference-to-diameter that is less than [[pi]].

=== Gauss and Poincaré ===
[[Image:Carl Friedrich Gauss.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]]]
[[Image:Young Poincare.jpg|left|upright|thumb|[[Henri Poincaré]]]]

Although there was a prevailing Kantian consensus at the time, once non-Euclidean geometries had been formalised, some began to wonder whether or not physical space is curved. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], a German mathematician, was the first to consider an empirical investigation of the geometrical structure of space. He thought of making a test of the sum of the angles of an enormous stellar triangle, and there are reports that he actually carried out a test, on a small scale, by [[triangulation|triangulating]] mountain tops in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap, R. ''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science''. pp. 134–136.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henri Poincaré]], a French mathematician and physicist of the late 19th century, introduced an important insight in which he attempted to demonstrate the futility of any attempt to discover which geometry applies to space by experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Jammer, Max (1954). ''Concepts of Space. The History of Theories of Space in Physics''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; He considered the predicament that would face scientists if they were confined to the surface of an imaginary large sphere with particular properties, known as a [[sphere-world]]. In this world, the temperature is taken to vary in such a way that all objects expand and contract in similar proportions in different places on the sphere. With a suitable falloff in temperature, if the scientists try to use measuring rods to determine the sum of the angles in a triangle, they can be deceived into thinking that they inhabit a plane, rather than a spherical surface.&lt;ref&gt;A medium with a variable index of refraction could also be used to bend the path of light and again deceive the scientists if they attempt to use light to map out their geometry.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the scientists cannot in principle determine whether they inhabit a plane or sphere and, Poincaré argued, the same is true for the debate over whether real space is Euclidean or not. For him, which geometry was used to describe space was a matter of [[Conventionalism|convention]].&lt;ref&gt;Carnap, R. ''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science''. p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[Euclidean geometry]] is simpler than non-Euclidean geometry, he assumed the former would always be used to describe the 'true' geometry of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Sklar, L. ''Philosophy of Physics''. p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Einstein ===
[[Image:Albert Einstein Head.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[Albert Einstein]]]]
In 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] published his [[special theory of relativity]], which led to the concept that space and time can be viewed as a single construct known as ''[[spacetime]]''. In this theory, the [[speed of light]] in a [[vacuum]] is the same for all observers—which has [[relativity of simultaneity|the result]] that two events that appear simultaneous to one particular observer will not be simultaneous to another observer if the observers are moving with respect to one another. Moreover, an observer will measure a moving clock to [[time dilation|tick more slowly]] than one that is stationary with respect to them; and objects are measured [[length contraction|to be shortened]] in the direction that they are moving with respect to the observer.

Subsequently, Einstein worked on a [[general theory of relativity]], which is a theory of how [[gravity]] interacts with spacetime. Instead of viewing gravity as a [[Force field (physics)|force field]] acting in spacetime, Einstein suggested that it modifies the geometric structure of spacetime itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sklar, L. ''Philosophy of Physics''. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the general theory, time [[gravitational time dilation|goes more slowly]] at places with lower gravitational potentials and rays of light bend in the presence of a gravitational field. Scientists have studied the behaviour of [[binary pulsar]]s, confirming the predictions of Einstein's theories, and non-Euclidean geometry is usually used to describe spacetime.

== Mathematics ==
{{main|Three-dimensional space}}
{{distinguish|Space (mathematics)}}
In modern mathematics [[Mathematical space|spaces]] are defined as [[set (mathematics)|sets]] with some added structure. They are frequently described as different types of [[manifold]]s, which are spaces that locally approximate to Euclidean space, and where the properties are defined largely on local connectedness of points that lie on the manifold. There are however, many diverse mathematical objects that are called spaces. For example, [[vector space]]s such as [[function space]]s may have infinite numbers of independent dimensions and a notion of distance very different from Euclidean space, and [[topological space]]s replace the concept of distance with a more abstract idea of nearness.

== Physics ==
{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Fundamental concepts}}
{{more citations needed|date=April 2020}}
Space is one of the few [[fundamental quantity|fundamental quantities]] in [[physics]], meaning that it cannot be defined via other quantities because nothing more fundamental is known at the present. On the other hand, it can be related to other fundamental quantities. Thus, similar to other fundamental quantities (like time and [[mass]]), space can be explored via [[measurement]] and experiment.

Today, our [[three-dimensional space]] is viewed as embedded in a four-dimensional [[spacetime]], called [[Minkowski space]] (see [[special relativity]]).  The idea behind space-time is that time is [[hyperbolic-orthogonal]] to each of the three spatial dimensions.

=== Relativity ===
{{main|Theory of relativity}}
{{more citations needed|date=April 2020}}
Before [[Albert Einstein]]'s work on relativistic physics, time and space were viewed as independent dimensions. Einstein's discoveries showed that due to relativity of motion our space and time can be mathematically combined into one object–[[spacetime]]. It turns out that distances in [[Spacetime#Space-like interval|space]] or in [[Spacetime#Time-like interval|time]] separately are not invariant with respect to Lorentz coordinate transformations, but distances in Minkowski space-time along [[space-time interval]]s are—which justifies the name.

In addition, time and space dimensions should not be viewed as exactly equivalent in Minkowski space-time. One can freely move in space but not in time. Thus, time and space coordinates are treated differently both in [[special relativity]] (where time is sometimes considered an [[imaginary number|imaginary]] coordinate) and in [[general relativity]] (where different signs are assigned to time and space components of [[spacetime]] [[metric tensor|metric]]).

Furthermore, in [[Einstein's general theory of relativity]], it is postulated that space-time is geometrically distorted – ''curved'' – near to gravitationally significant masses.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, John A. ''A Journey into Gravity and Spacetime''. Chapters 8 and 9, [[Scientific American]], {{ISBN|0-7167-6034-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One consequence of this postulate, which follows from the equations of general relativity, is the prediction of moving ripples of space-time, called [[gravitational wave]]s. While indirect evidence for these waves has been found (in the motions of the [[Hulse–Taylor binary]] system, for example) experiments attempting to directly measure these waves are ongoing at the [[LIGO]] and [[Virgo interferometer|Virgo]] collaborations. LIGO scientists reported the [[first observation of gravitational waves|first such direct observation of gravitational waves]] on 14 September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Castelvecchi|first1=Davide|last2=Witze|first2=Alexandra|title=Einstein's gravitational waves found at last|url=http://www.nature.com/news/einstein-s-gravitational-waves-found-at-last-1.19361|accessdate=12 January 2018|work=Nature News|date=11 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216095503/http://www.nature.com/news/einstein-s-gravitational-waves-found-at-last-1.19361|archive-date=16 February 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PRL"&gt;{{cite journal |collaboration=LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration |last1=Abbott |first1=Benjamin P. |title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger |journal=[[Phys.

=== Cosmology ===
{{main|Shape of the universe}}
{{more citations needed|date=April 2020}}
Relativity theory leads to the [[cosmology|cosmological]] question of what shape the universe is, and where space came from. It appears that space was created in the [[Big Bang]], 13.8&amp;nbsp;billion years ago&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; and has been expanding ever since. The overall shape of space is not known, but space is known to be expanding very rapidly due to the [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmic inflation]].

== Spatial measurement ==
{{main|Measurement}}
{{more citations needed|date=April 2020}}
The measurement of ''physical space'' has long been important. Although earlier societies had developed measuring systems, the [[SI|International System of Units]], (SI), is now the most common system of units used in the measuring of space, and is almost universally used.

Currently, the standard space interval, called a standard meter or simply meter, is defined as the [[speed of light|distance traveled by light in a vacuum]] during a time interval of exactly 1/299,792,458 of a second. This definition coupled with present definition of the second is based on the [[special theory of relativity]] in which the [[speed of light]] plays the role of a fundamental constant of nature.

== Geographical space ==
{{See also|Spatial analysis}}
{{more citations needed|date=April 2020}}
[[Geography]] is the branch of science concerned with identifying and describing places on [[Earth]], utilizing spatial awareness to try to understand why things exist in specific locations. [[Cartography]] is the mapping of spaces to allow better navigation, for visualization purposes and to act as a locational device. [[Geostatistics]] apply statistical concepts to collected spatial data of Earth to create an estimate for unobserved phenomena.

Geographical space is often considered as land, and can have a relation to [[ownership]] usage (in which space is seen as [[property]] or territory). While some cultures assert the rights of the individual in terms of ownership, other cultures will identify with a communal approach to land ownership, while still other cultures such as [[Australian Aboriginals]], rather than asserting ownership rights to land, invert the relationship and consider that they are in fact owned by the land. [[Spatial planning]] is a method of regulating the use of space at land-level, with decisions made at regional, national and international levels. Space can also impact on human and cultural behavior, being an important factor in architecture, where it will impact on the design of buildings and structures, and on farming.

Ownership of space is not restricted to land. Ownership of [[airspace]] and of [[International waters|waters]] is decided internationally. Other forms of ownership have been recently asserted to other spaces—for example to the radio bands of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] or to [[cyberspace]].

[[Public space]] is a term used to define areas of land as collectively owned by the community, and managed in their name by delegated bodies; such spaces are open to all, while [[private property]] is the land culturally owned by an individual or company, for their own use and pleasure.

[[Abstract space]] is a term used in [[geography]] to refer to a hypothetical space characterized by complete homogeneity. When modeling activity or behavior, it is a conceptual tool used to limit [[extraneous variables]] such as terrain.

== In psychology ==
{{more citations needed|date=April 2020}}
Psychologists first began to study the way space is perceived in the middle of the 19th century. Those now concerned with such studies regard it as a distinct branch of [[psychology]]. Psychologists analyzing the perception of space are concerned with how recognition of an object's physical appearance or its interactions are perceived, see, for example, [[visual space]].

Other, more specialized topics studied include [[amodal perception]] and [[object permanence]]. The [[perception]] of surroundings is important due to its necessary relevance to survival, especially with regards to [[hunting]] and [[self preservation]] as well as simply one's idea of [[personal space]].

Several space-related [[phobia]]s have been identified, including [[agoraphobia]] (the fear of open spaces), [[wikt:astrophobia|astrophobia]] (the fear of celestial space) and [[claustrophobia]] (the fear of enclosed spaces).

The understanding of three-dimensional space in humans is thought to be learned during infancy using [[visual perception#Unconscious inference|unconscious inference]], and is closely related to [[hand-eye coordination]]. The visual ability to perceive the world in three dimensions is called [[depth perception]].

== In the social sciences ==
Space has been studied in the social sciences from the perspectives of [[Marxism]], [[feminism]], [[postmodernism]], [[postcolonialism]], [[urban theory]] and [[critical geography]]. These theories account for the effect of the history of colonialism, transatlantic slavery and globalization on our understanding and experience of space and place. The topic has garnered attention since the 1980s, after the publication of [[Henri Lefebvre]]'s ''The Production of Space .'' In this book, Lefebvre applies Marxist ideas about the production of commodities and accumulation of capital to discuss space as a social product. His focus is on the multiple and overlapping social processes that produce space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Henri Lefebvre on Space : Architecture, Urban Research, and the Production of Theory.|last=Stanek|first=Lukasz|publisher=Univ of Minnesota Press|year=2011|pages=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''The Condition of Postmodernity,'' [[David Harvey]] describes what he terms the "[[time-space compression]]." This is the effect of technological advances and capitalism on our perception of time, space and distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199874002/obo-9780199874002-0025.xml|title=Time-Space Compression – Geography – Oxford Bibliographies – obo|access-date=28 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180920011023/http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199874002/obo-9780199874002-0025.xml|archive-date=20 September 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the modes of production and consumption of capital affect and are affected by developments in transportation and technology. These advances create relationships across time and space, new markets and groups of wealthy elites in urban centers, all of which annihilate distances and affect our perception of linearity and distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Spaces of Capital : Towards a Critical Geography|last=Harvey|first=David|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2001|pages=244–246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Thirdspace,'' [[Edward Soja]] describes space and spatiality as an integral and neglected aspect of what he calls the "[[trialectics of being]]," the three modes that determine how we inhabit, experience and understand the world. He argues that critical theories in the Humanities and Social Sciences study the historical and social dimensions of our lived experience, neglecting the spatial dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thirdspace : journeys to Los Angeles and other real-and-imagined places|last=W.|first=Soja, Edward|date=1996|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=978-1-55786-674-5|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=33863376}}&lt;/ref&gt; He builds on Henri Lefebvre's work to address the dualistic way in which humans understand space—as either material/physical or as represented/imagined. Lefebvre's "lived space"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The production of space|last=1901–1991.|first=Lefebvre, Henri|date=1991|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=978-0-631-14048-1|location=Oxford, OX, UK|oclc=22624721}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Soja's "thridspace" are terms that account for the complex ways in which humans understand and navigate place, which "firstspace" and "Secondspace" (Soja's terms for material and imagined spaces respectively) do not fully encompass.

[[Postcolonialism|Postcolonial]] theorist [[Homi K. Bhabha|Homi Bhabha]]'s concept of [[Third Space Theory|Third Space]] is different from Soja's Thirdspace, even though both terms offer a way to think outside the terms of a [[Binary opposition|binary]] logic. Bhabha's Third Space is the space in which hybrid cultural forms and identities exist. In his theories, the term [[Hybridity|hybrid]] describes new cultural forms that emerge through the interaction between colonizer and colonized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Postcolonial studies : the key concepts|last=1946–|first=Ashcroft, Bill|others=Griffiths, Gareth, 1943–, Tiffin, Helen., Ashcroft, Bill, 1946–|isbn=978-0-415-66190-4|edition= Third|location=London|oclc=824119565|year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="3837" xml:space="preserve">The curved '''point-normal triangle''', in short '''PN triangle''', is an interpolation algorithm to retrieve a cubic [[Bézier triangle]] from the vertex coordinates of a regular [[Triangle|flat triangle]] and [[Normal (geometry)|normal vectors]]. The PN triangle retains the [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of the flat triangle as well as the corresponding normals. It was first introduced by A. Vlachos et al. in 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Vlachos|first=Alex|last2=Peters|first2=Jörg|last3=Boyd|first3=Chas|last4=Mitchell|first4=Jason L.|date=2001-03-01|title=Curved PN triangles|url=https://archive.org/details/siggraph2001conf00fium/page/159|publisher=ACM|pages=[https://archive.org/details/siggraph2001conf00fium/page/159 159–166]|doi=10.1145/364338.364387|isbn=978-1581132922|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is primarily used in the field of [[computer graphics]]. The usage of the PN triangle enables the visualization of triangle based surfaces in a smoother shape at low cost in terms of rendering complexity and time.

&lt;/math&gt;This definition ensures that the original [[vertex normal]]s are reproduced in the interpolated triangle.

Finally the internal control point &lt;math display="inline"&gt;(i=j=k=1)
&lt;/math&gt;is derived from the previously calculated control points as&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{b}_{111} &amp;= \mathbf{E} + \frac{1}{2} \left(\mathbf{E} - \mathbf{V}\right)\\
\text{with}&amp;\quad \mathbf{E} = \frac{1}{6} \left(\mathbf{b}_{012} + \mathbf{b}_{021} + \mathbf{b}_{102} + \mathbf{b}_{201} + \mathbf{b}_{120} + \mathbf{b}_{210}\right)\\

{{short description|shape with nine sides}}
In [[geometry]], a '''nonagon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɒ|n|ə|g|ɒ|n}}) or '''enneagon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|n|i|ə|ɡ|ɒ|n}}) is a nine-sided [[polygon]] or 9-gon.

The name ''nonagon'' is a [[prefix]] [[Hybrid word|hybrid formation]], from [[Latin]] (''nonus'', "ninth" + ''gonon''), used equivalently, attested already in the 16th century in French ''nonogone'' and in English from the 17th century. The name ''enneagon'' comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''enneagonon'' (εννεα, "nine" + γωνον (from γωνία = "corner")), and is arguably more correct,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=[[Eric W. Weisstein]] |title=Nonagon |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Nonagon.html |website=[http://mathworld.wolfram.com&gt; MathWorld]--A Wolfram Web Resource |access-date=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; though less common than "nonagon".

== Regular nonagon ==
A ''[[regular polygon|regular]] nonagon'' is represented by [[Schläfli symbol]] {9} and has [[internal angle]]s of 140°. The area of a regular nonagon of side length ''a'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{9}{4}a^2\cot\frac{\pi}{9}=(9/2)ar = 9r^2\tan(\pi/9) &lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;= (9/2)R^2\sin(2\pi/9)\simeq6.18182\,a^2,&lt;/math&gt;

where the radius ''r'' of the [[inscribed circle]] of the regular nonagon is

:&lt;math&gt;r=(a/2)\cot(\pi/9)&lt;/math&gt;

and where ''R'' is the radius of its [[circumscribed circle]]:

:&lt;math&gt;R = \sqrt{(a/2)^2 + r^2 }=r\sec(\pi/9).&lt;/math&gt;

==Construction==
Although a regular nonagon is not [[constructible polygon|constructible]] with [[compass and straightedge]] (as 9 = 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is not a product of distinct [[Fermat prime]]s), there are very old methods of construction that produce very close approximations.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Berggren, [https://books.google.de/books?id=MPTxBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=%22The+Construction+of+the+Regular+Nonagon%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Kea3Fz2Q_o&amp;sig=baDTPI6FwF_bHwTSDBsqE_U0fs8&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidzJbdkNTJAhVBsiwKHfQvD2EQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20Construction%20of%20the%20Regular%20Nonagon%22&amp;f=false "Episodes in the Mathematics of Medieval Islam", p. 82 - 85] Springer-Verlag New York, Inc. 1st edition 1986, retrieved on 11 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be also constructed using [[neusis construction|neusis]], or by allowing the use of an [[Angle trisection|angle trisector]].

[[File:Meccano nonagon.svg|thumb|Nonagon constructed with 36 meccano equal bars.]]
The nonagon can be constructed with 36 [[meccano]] equal bars. The construction includes 9 equilateral triangles. Bars are disposed in four levels. Physical models are possible selecting correctly the size of the pieces in order bars and bolts don't obstruct anything else.

==Approximations==
===Approximation I===
: Accuracy (linear): 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;!-- From the text below--&gt;
The following is an ''approximate'' construction of a nonagon using a [[straightedge]] and [[Compass (drawing tool)|compass]].

''Example to illustrate the error, when the constructed central angle is 39.99906°:''&lt;br /&gt;
At a circumscribed circle radius r = 100&amp;nbsp;m, the absolute error of the 1st side would be approximately 1.6&amp;nbsp;mm.

{{clear}}

===Approximation II===
: Accuracy (linear): 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;!-- From the text below --&gt;

*Downsize the angle JMK (also 60°) with four [[bisections]] of angle and make a thirds of circular arc MON with an approximate solution between bisections of angle w&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and w&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.
*Straight [[auxiliary line]] g aims over the point O to the point N (virtually a ruler at the points O and N applied), between O and N, therefore no auxiliary line.

:Thus, the [[circular arc]] MON is freely accessible for the later intersection point R.

:&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\angle{}&lt;/math&gt; RMK = 40.0000000052441...°

:360° ÷ 9 = 40°

:&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\angle{}&lt;/math&gt; RMK - 40° = 5.2...E-9°

:''Example to illustrate the error'':

:At a circumscribed circle radius

:r = 100,000&amp;nbsp;km, the absolute error of the 1st side would be approximately 8.6&amp;nbsp;mm.

== Symmetry ==
[[File:Regular enneagon symmetries.png|thumb|200px|Symmetries of a regular enneagon. Vertices are colored by their symmetry positions. Blue mirrors are drawn through vertices, and purple mirrors are drawn through edge. Gyration orders are given in the center.]]

The ''regular enneagon'' has [[dihedral symmetry|Dih&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry]], order 18. There are 2 subgroup dihedral symmetries: Dih&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Dih&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and 3 [[cyclic group]] symmetries: Z&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;, Z&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and Z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

These 6 symmetries can be seen in 6 distinct symmetries on the enneagon. [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] labels these by a letter and group order.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Conway, Heidi Burgiel, [[Chaim Goodman-Strauss]], (2008) The Symmetries of Things, {{isbn|978-1-56881-220-5}} (Chapter 20, Generalized Schaefli symbols, Types of symmetry of a polygon pp. 275-278)&lt;/ref&gt; Full symmetry of the regular form is '''r18''' and no symmetry is labeled '''a1'''. The dihedral symmetries are divided depending on whether they pass through vertices ('''d''' for diagonal) or edges ('''p''' for perpendiculars), and '''i''' when reflection lines path through both edges and vertices. Cyclic symmetries in the middle column are labeled as '''g''' for their central gyration orders.

Each subgroup symmetry allows one or more degrees of freedom for irregular forms. Only the '''g9''' subgroup has no degrees of freedom but can seen as [[directed edge]]s.

== Tilings ==

The regular enneagon can tessellate the euclidean tiling with gaps. These gaps can be filled with regular hexagons and isosceles triangles. In the notation of [[symmetrohedron]] this tiling is called H(*;3;*;[2]) with H representing *632 hexagonal symmetry in the plane.
:[[File:Conway tiling dKH.png|320px]]

==Graphs==
The K&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; [[complete graph]] is often drawn as a ''regular enneagon'' with all 36 edges connected. This graph also represents an [[orthographic projection]] of the 9 vertices and 36 edges of the [[8-simplex]].

==Pop culture references==
*[[They Might Be Giants]] have a song entitled "Nonagon" on their children's album ''[[Here Come the 123s]]''. It refers to both an attendee at a party at which "everybody in the party is a many-sided polygon" and a dance they perform at this party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tmbw.net/wiki/Lyrics:Nonagon TMBW.net]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]]'s logo is also a version of a nonagon, being a nine-pointed star made of three triangles, referring to the nine members.
*[[King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard]] have an album titled '[[Nonagon Infinity]]', the album art featuring a nonagonal complete graph. The album consists of nine songs and repeats cyclically.

==Architecture==
Temples of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], called [[Bahá'í Houses of Worship]], are required to be nonagonal.

The [[U.S. Steel Tower]] is an irregular nonagon.

      <text bytes="6631" xml:space="preserve">A '''similarity system of triangles''' is a specific configuration involving a set of triangles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mauldon|first=J.G.|date=May 1966|title=Similar Triangles|url=|journal=Mathematics Magazine|volume=39|issue=3|pages=165–174|via=|doi=10.1080/0025570X.1966.11975709}}&lt;/ref&gt; A set of triangles is considered a [[Configuration (geometry)|configuration]] when all of the triangles share a minimum of one incidence relation with one of the other triangles present in the set.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An [[Incidence (geometry)|incidence relation]] between triangles refers to when two triangles share a point. For example, the two triangles to the right, &lt;math&gt;AHC&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;BHC&lt;/math&gt;, are a configuration made up of two incident relations, since points &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;are shared. The triangles that make up configurations are known as component triangles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Triangles must not only be a part of a configuration set to be in a similarity system, but must also be directly similar.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Direct similarity implies that all angles are equal between two given triangle and that they share the same rotational sense.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Similar.html|title=Similar|last=Weisstein|first=Eric|website=Wolfram MathWorld|access-date=2018-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; As is seen in the adjacent images, in the directly similar triangles, the rotation of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; onto  &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B^1&lt;/math&gt;  onto  &lt;math&gt;C^1&lt;/math&gt;occurs in the same direction. In the opposite similar triangles, the rotation of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; onto  &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B^1&lt;/math&gt;onto  &lt;math&gt;C^1&lt;/math&gt;occurs in the opposite direction. In sum, a configuration is a similarity system when all triangles in the set, lie in the same plane and the following holds true: if there are ''n'' triangles in the set and ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 triangles are directly similar, then n triangles are directly similar.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Background ==
J.G. Mauldon introduced the idea of similarity systems of triangles in his paper in &lt;u&gt;Mathematics Magazine&lt;/u&gt; "Similar Triangles".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Mauldon began his analyses by examining given triangles &lt;math&gt;ABC, XYZ&lt;/math&gt; for direct similarity through complex numbers, specifically the equation &lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix} a &amp; b &amp; c \\ x &amp; y &amp; z \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \end{vmatrix} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He then furthered his analyses to equilateral triangles, showing that if a triangle &lt;math&gt;ABC&lt;/math&gt; satisfied the equation &lt;math&gt;a + wb + w^2c =0&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;w = \frac{-1 + i\surd3}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, it was equilateral.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As evidence of this work, he applied his conjectures on direct similarity and equilateral triangles in proving [[Napoleon's theorem]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He then built off Napoleon by proving that if an equilateral triangle was constructed with equilateral triangles incident on each vertex, the midpoints of the connecting lines between the non-incident vertices of the outer three equilateral triangles create an equilateral triangle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other similar work was done by the French Geometer [[Victor Thébault|Thébault]] in his proof that given a parallelogram and squares that lie on each side of the parallelogram, the centers of the squares create a square.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerber|first=Leon|date=October 1980|title=Napoleon's Theorem and the Parallelogram Inequality for Affine-Regular Polygons|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|volume=87|issue=8|pages=644–648|jstor=2320952|doi=10.1080/00029890.1980.11995110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mauldon then analyzed coplanar sets of triangles, determining if they were similarity systems based on the criterion, if all but one of the triangles were directly similar, then all of the triangles are directly similar.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Examples ==
=== Triangles appended to a rectangle ===
==== Direct similarity ====
If we construct a rectangle &lt;math&gt;ABCD&lt;/math&gt; with directly similar triangles &lt;math&gt;PAB, QBC, RCD, SDA&lt;/math&gt; on each side of the rectangle that are similar to &lt;math&gt;PQS&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;RQS&lt;/math&gt; is directly similar and the set of triangles &lt;math&gt;\{PAB, QBC, RCD, SDA, PQS, RQS\}&lt;/math&gt; is a similarity system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Indirect similarity ====
However, if we acknowledge that the triangles can be degenerate and take points &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to lie on each other and &lt;math&gt;Q, R, D&lt;/math&gt;and  &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; to lie on each other, then the set of triangles is no longer a direct similarity system since the second triangle has area and the others do not.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Rectangular parallelepiped ===
Given a figure where three sets of lines are parallel, but not equivalent in length (formally known as a rectangular [[parallelepiped]]) with all points of order two being labelled as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;\{A_1B_1C_1, A_2B_2C_2, A_3B_3C_3, A_4B_4C_4, A_1B_4C_3, A_2B_3C_4, A_3B_2C_1, A_4B_1C_2\}&lt;/math&gt;

Then we can take the above points, analyze them as triangles and we can show that they form a similarity system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Proof:''

In order for any given triangle, &lt;math&gt;KLM&lt;/math&gt;, to be directly similar to &lt;math&gt;A_1, B_1, C_1&lt;/math&gt;the following equation should be satisfied:

: &lt;math&gt;(\ell-m)a_1+ (m-k)b_1+(k-1)c_1=0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   where ''ℓ'', ''m'', ''k'', ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are sides of triangles.

If the same pattern is followed for the rest of the triangles, one will notice that the summation of the equations for the first four triangles and the summation of the equations for the last four triangles provides the same result.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Therefore, by the definition of a similarity system of triangles, no matter the seven similar triangles selected, the eighth will satisfy the system, making them all directly similar.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Mathematical symmetry may be observed with respect to the passage of [[time]]; as a [[space|spatial relationship]]; through [[geometric transformation]]s; through other kinds of functional transformations; and as an aspect of [[abstract object]]s, including [[scientific model|theoretic models]], [[language]], and [[music]].&lt;ref name="Mainzer000"&gt;{{cite book |title = Symmetry And Complexity: The Spirit and Beauty of Nonlinear Science |first = Klaus |last = Mainzer |publisher = World Scientific |year = 2005 |isbn = 981-256-192-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Symmetric objects can be material, such as a person, [[crystal]], [[quilt]], [[Pamment|floor tiles]], or [[molecule]], or it can be an [[abstract object|abstract]] structure such as a [[mathematical equation]] or a series of tones ([[music]]).}}

This article describes symmetry from three perspectives: in [[mathematics]], including [[geometry]], the most familiar type of symmetry for many people; in [[science]] and [[nature]]; and in the arts, covering [[architecture]], [[art]] and [[music]].

The opposite of symmetry is [[asymmetry]], which refers to the absence or a violation of symmetry.

{{main|Symmetry (geometry)}}
[[File:The armoured triskelion on the flag of the Isle of Man.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|The [[triskelion]] has 3-fold rotational symmetry.]]

A geometric shape or object is symmetric if it can be divided into two or more identical pieces that are arranged in an organized fashion.&lt;ref&gt;E. H. Lockwood, R. H. Macmillan, ''Geometric Symmetry'', London: Cambridge Press,
1978&lt;/ref&gt; This means that an object is symmetric if there is a transformation that moves individual pieces of the object, but doesn't change the overall shape. The type of symmetry is determined by the way the pieces are organized, or by the type of transformation:

* An object has [[reflectional symmetry]] (line or mirror symmetry) if there is a line (or in [[three-dimensional space|3D]] a plane) going through it which divides it into two pieces that are mirror images of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Symmetry |last=Weyl |first=Hermann |authorlink=Hermann Weyl |year=1982 |origyear=1952 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton | isbn=0-691-02374-3 |pages= |url= |ref=Weyl 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*An object has [[rotational symmetry]] if the object can be rotated about a fixed point (or in 3D about a line) without changing the overall shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Singer, David A. | year=1998 | title=Geometry: Plane and Fancy | url=https://archive.org/details/geometryplanefan0000sing | url-access=registration | publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*An object has [[translational symmetry]] if it can be [[translation (geometry)|translated]] (moving every point of the object by the same distance) without changing its overall shape.&lt;ref&gt;Stenger, Victor J. (2000) and Mahou Shiro (2007). ''Timeless Reality''. Prometheus Books. Especially chapter 12. Nontechnical.&lt;/ref&gt;
*An object has [[helical symmetry]] if it can be simultaneously translated and rotated in three-dimensional space along a line known as a [[screw axis]].&lt;ref&gt;Bottema, O, and B. Roth, ''Theoretical Kinematics,'' Dover Publications (September 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;
*An object has '''scale symmetry''' if it does not change shape when it is expanded or contracted.&lt;ref&gt;Tian Yu Cao ''Conceptual Foundations of Quantum Field Theory'' Cambridge University Press p.154-155&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fractals]] also exhibit a form of scale symmetry, where smaller portions of the fractal are [[similarity (geometry)|similar]] in shape to larger portions.&lt;ref name="Gouyet"&gt;{{cite book | last = Gouyet | first = Jean-François | title = Physics and fractal structures | publisher = Masson Springer | location = Paris/New York | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-387-94153-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Other symmetries include [[glide reflection]] symmetry (a reflection followed by a translation) and [[improper rotation|rotoreflection]] symmetry (a combination of a rotation and a reflection&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/rotoreflection+axis|title=Rotoreflection Axis|last=|first=|date=|website=TheFreeDictionary.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

===In logic===

A [[binary relation|dyadic relation]] ''R'' = ''S'' × ''S'' is symmetric if for each element ''a'', ''b'' in ''S'', whenever it is true that ''Rab'', it is also true that ''Rba''.&lt;ref&gt;Josiah Royce, Ignas K. Skrupskelis (2005) ''The Basic Writings of Josiah Royce: Logic, loyalty, and community (Google eBook)'' Fordham Univ Press, p. 790&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the relation "is the same age as" is symmetric, for if Paul is the same age as Mary, then Mary is the same age as Paul.

In propositional logic, symmetric binary [[logical connective]]s include ''[[logical conjunction|and]]'' (∧, or &amp;), ''[[logical disjunction|or]]'' (∨, or |) and ''[[if and only if]]'' (↔), while the connective ''if'' (→) is not symmetric.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~a23gao/cs245_f19/slides/lec02_prop_syntax_nosol.pdf|title=Propositional Logic: Introduction and Syntax|last=Gao|first=Alice|date=2019|website=University of Waterloo — School of Computer Science|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other symmetric logical connectives include ''[[logical nand|nand]]'' (not-and, or ⊼), ''[[xor]]'' (not-biconditional, or ⊻), and ''[[logical nor|nor]]'' (not-or, or ⊽).

===Other areas of mathematics===
{{main|Symmetry in mathematics}}
Generalizing from geometrical symmetry in the previous section, one can say that a [[mathematical object]] is ''symmetric'' with respect to a given [[Operation (mathematics)|mathematical operation]], if, when applied to the object, this operation preserves some property of the object.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher G. Morris
 (1992) ''Academic Press Dictionary of Science and Technology'' Gulf Professional Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; The set of operations that preserve a given property of the object form a [[group (mathematics)|group]].

In general, every kind of structure in mathematics will have its own kind of symmetry. Examples include [[even and odd functions]] in [[calculus]], [[symmetric group|symmetric groups]] in [[abstract algebra]], [[symmetric matrix|symmetric matrices]] in [[linear algebra]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and [[Galois group|Galois groups]] in [[Galois theory]]. In [[statistics]], symmetry also manifests as [[symmetric probability distribution]]s, and as [[skewness]]—the asymmetry of distributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Petitjean, M. | title = Chirality and Symmetry Measures: A Transdisciplinary Review | journal = Entropy | year = 2003 | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages=271–312 (see section 2.9) | doi = 10.3390/e5030271| bibcode = 2003Entrp...5..271P | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In science and nature==

===In physics===
{{Main|Symmetry in physics}}

Symmetry in physics has been generalized to mean [[Invariant (physics)|invariance]]—that is, lack of change—under any kind of transformation, for example [[General covariance|arbitrary coordinate transformations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Symmetries and Group Theory in Particle Physics: An Introduction to Space-Time and Internal Symmetries |first1 = Giovanni |last1 = Costa |first2=Gianluigi |last2=Fogli| publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year = 2012 |page = 112}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has become one of the most powerful tools of [[theoretical physics]], as it has become evident that practically all laws of nature originate in symmetries. In fact, this role inspired the Nobel laureate [[Philip Warren Anderson|PW Anderson]] to write in his widely read 1972 article ''More is Different'' that "it is only slightly overstating the case to say that physics is the study of symmetry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Anderson | first=P.W. | title=More is Different | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=177 | issue=4047| pages=393–396 | year=1972 | url=http://robotics.cs.tamu.edu/dshell/cs689/papers/anderson72more_is_different.pdf | doi=10.1126/science.177.4047.393 | pmid=17796623 | format=|bibcode = 1972Sci...177..393A }}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Noether's theorem]] (which, in greatly simplified form, states that for every continuous mathematical symmetry, there is a corresponding conserved quantity such as energy or momentum; a conserved current, in Noether's original language);&lt;ref name=Noether&gt;{{Cite book | last = Kosmann-Schwarzbach | first = Yvette | authorlink = Yvette Kosmann-Schwarzbach | title = The Noether theorems: Invariance and conservation laws in the twentieth century | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]] | series = Sources and Studies in the History of Mathematics and Physical Sciences | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-0-387-87867-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also, [[Wigner's classification]], which says that the symmetries of the laws of physics determine the properties of the particles found in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=E. P.|last=Wigner|authorlink=Eugene Wigner|title=On unitary representations of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group|journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]]|issue=1|volume=40|pages=149–204|year=1939|doi=10.2307/1968551|mr=1503456 |bibcode = 1939AnMat..40..149W |jstor=1968551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Important symmetries in physics include [[continuous symmetry|continuous symmetries]] and [[discrete symmetry|discrete symmetries]] of [[spacetime]]; [[internal symmetry|internal symmetries]] of particles; and [[supersymmetry]] of physical theories.

===In biology===
{{Further|symmetry in biology|facial symmetry}}
[[File:Chance and a Half, Posing.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Many animals are approximately mirror-symmetric, though internal organs are often arranged asymmetrically.]]
[[File:Studio del Corpo Umano - Leonardo da Vinci.png|right|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s '[[Vitruvian Man]]' (ca. 1487) is often used as a representation of symmetry in the human body and, by extension, the natural universe.]]
In biology, the notion of symmetry is mostly used explicitly to describe body shapes. [[Bilateria|Bilateral animals]], including humans, are more or less symmetric with respect to the [[sagittal plane]] which divides the body into left and right halves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Valentine |first=James W. |title=Bilateria |url=http://www.accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=802620&amp;referURL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.accessscience.com%2fcontent.aspx%3fid%3d802620 |publisher=AccessScience |access-date=29 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118213208/http://www.accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=802620&amp;referURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.accessscience.com%2Fcontent.aspx%3Fid%3D802620 |archive-date=18 January 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Animals that move in one direction necessarily have upper and lower sides, head and tail ends, and therefore a left and a right. The [[cephalisation|head becomes specialized]] with a mouth and sense organs, and the body becomes bilaterally symmetric for the purpose of movement, with symmetrical pairs of muscles and skeletal elements, though internal organs often remain asymmetric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://biocongroup.eu/DA/Calendario_files/Bilateria.pdf | title=Animal Diversity (Third Edition) | publisher=McGraw-Hill | work=Chapter 8: Acoelomate Bilateral Animals | year=2002 | accessdate=October 25, 2012 |author1=Hickman, Cleveland P. |author2=Roberts, Larry S. |author3=Larson, Allan | page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants and sessile (attached) animals such as [[sea anemone]]s often have radial or [[rotational symmetry]], which suits them because food or threats may arrive from any direction. Fivefold symmetry is found in the [[echinoderms]], the group that includes [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s, and [[sea lilies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=What Shape is a Snowflake? Magical Numbers in Nature | publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson | author=Stewart, Ian | year=2001 | pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In biology, the notion of symmetry is also used as in physics, that is to say to describe the properties of the objects studied, including their interactions. A remarkable property of biological evolution is the changes of symmetry corresponding to the appearance of new parts and dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.springer.com/la/book/9783642359378 |title=Perspectives on Organisms: Biological time, Symmetries and Singularities |last1=Longo |first1=Giuseppe |last2=Montévil |first2=Maël |date=2016 |publisher=Springer  |isbn=978-3-662-51229-6 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Montévil |first1=Maël |last2=Mossio |first2=Matteo |last3=Pocheville |first3=Arnaud |last4=Longo |first4=Giuseppe |date=2016 |title=Theoretical principles for biology: Variation |url=https://www.academia.edu/27942089 |journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology |series=From the Century of the Genome to the Century of the Organism: New Theoretical Approaches |volume=122 |issue=1 |pages=36–50 |doi=10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2016.08.005|pmid=27530930 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In chemistry===
{{Main|molecular symmetry}}

Symmetry is important to [[chemistry]] because it undergirds essentially all ''specific'' interactions between molecules in nature (i.e.,  via the interaction of natural and human-made [[chiral (chemistry)|chiral]] molecules with inherently chiral biological systems). The control of the [[molecular symmetry|symmetry]] of molecules produced in modern [[chemical synthesis]] contributes to the ability of scientists to offer [[drug|therapeutic]] interventions with minimal [[side effects]]. A rigorous understanding of symmetry explains fundamental observations in [[quantum chemistry]], and in the applied areas of [[spectroscopy]] and [[crystallography]]. The theory and application of symmetry to these areas of [[physical science]] draws heavily on the mathematical area of [[group theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lowe, John P |author2=Peterson, Kirk | title=Quantum Chemistry | publisher=Academic Press| edition=Third | year=2005 | isbn=0-12-457551-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In psychology and neuroscience===
{{Further|Visual perception}}

For a human observer, some symmetry types are more salient than others, in particular the most salient is a reflection with a vertical axis, like that present in the human face. [[Ernst Mach]] made this observation in his book "The analysis of sensations" (1897),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Symmetries and Group Theory in Particle Physics: An Introduction to Space-Time and Internal Symmetries | first1 = Ernst |last1 = Mach | publisher = Open Court Publishing House |year = 1897}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this implies that perception of symmetry is not a general response to all types of regularities. Both behavioural and neurophysiological studies have confirmed the special sensitivity to reflection symmetry in humans and also in other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wagemans, J.|title=Characteristics and models of human symmetry detection|journal=[[Trends in Cognitive Sciences]]|volume=1|issue=9|pages=346–352| year=1997|doi= 10.1016/S1364-6613(97)01105-4|pmid=21223945|s2cid=2143353}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early studies within the [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] tradition suggested that bilateral symmetry was one of the key factors in perceptual [[Principles of grouping|grouping]]. This is known as the [[Gestalt psychology#Law of Symmetry|Law of Symmetry]]. The role of symmetry in grouping and figure/ground organization has been confirmed in many studies. For instance, detection of reflectional symmetry is faster when this is a property of a single object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Bertamini, M.| title=Sensitivity to reflection and translation is modulated by objectness | journal=[[Perception (journal)|Perception]]| volume=39|pages=27–40| year=2010| issue=1 | doi=10.1068/p6393| pmid=20301844 | s2cid=22451173 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of human perception and psychophysics have shown that detection of symmetry is fast, efficient and robust to perturbations. For example, symmetry can be detected with presentations between 100 and 150 milliseconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Barlow, H.B.|author2=Reeves, B.C.|title=The versatility and absolute efficiency of detecting mirror symmetry in random dot displays|journal=[[Vision Research]]|volume=19|issue=7|pages=783–793|year=1979|doi= 10.1016/0042-6989(79)90154-8|pmid=483597|s2cid=41530752}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

More recent neuroimaging studies have documented which brain regions are active during perception of symmetry. Sasaki et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sasaki, Y.|author2=Vanduffel, W.|author3=Knutsen, T.|author4=Tyler, C.W.|author5=Tootell, R.|title=Symmetry activates extrastriate visual cortex in human and nonhuman primates |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA]]|volume=102|issue=8|pages=3159–3163|year=2005|doi= 10.1073/pnas.0500319102|pmid=15710884|pmc=549500|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare responses for patterns with symmetrical or random dots. A strong activity was present in extrastriate regions of the occipital cortex but not in the primary visual cortex. The extrastriate regions included V3A, V4, V7, and the lateral occipital complex (LOC). Electrophysiological studies have found a late posterior negativity that originates from the same areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Makin, A.D.J. |author2=Rampone, G. |author3= Pecchinenda, A. |author4= Bertamini, M. |title= Electrophysiological responses to visuospatial regularity |journal=[[Psychophysiology]]| volume=50| pages= 1045–1055|year=2013|doi=10.1111/psyp.12082|pmid=23941638 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, a large part of the visual system seems to be involved in processing visual symmetry, and these areas involve similar networks to those responsible for detecting and recognising objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bertamini, M.|author2=Silvanto, J. |author3=Norcia, A.M. |author4=Makin, A.D.J. |author5= Wagemans, J. |title=The neural basis of visual symmetry and its role in middle and high-level visual processing |journal=[[Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences]]|volume=132|pages=280–293|year=2018|doi=10.1111/nyas.13667|pmid=29604083 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In social interactions==
People observe the symmetrical nature, often including asymmetrical balance, of social interactions in a variety of contexts. These include assessments of [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]], [[empathy]], [[sympathy]], [[Remorse|apology]], [[dialogue]], respect, [[justice]], and [[revenge]].
[[Reflective equilibrium]] is the balance that may be attained through deliberative mutual adjustment among general principles and specific [[judgment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=reflective-equilibrium |title=Reflective Equilibrium |last=Daniels |first=Norman |author-link=Norman Daniels |date=2003-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Symmetrical interactions send the [[morality|moral]] message "we are all the same" while asymmetrical interactions may send the message "I am special; better than you." Peer relationships, such as can be governed by the [[golden rule]], are based on symmetry, whereas power relationships are based on asymmetry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/symmetry.htm Emotional Competency]: Symmetry&lt;/ref&gt; Symmetrical relationships can to some degree be maintained by simple ([[game theory]]) strategies seen in [[symmetric games]] such as [[tit for tat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lutus|first1=P.|title=The Symmetry Principle|url=http://www.arachnoid.com/symmetry/details.html|accessdate=28 September 2015|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In pottery and metal vessels===
[[File:Makingpottery.jpg|thumb|right|Clay pots thrown on a [[pottery wheel]] acquire rotational symmetry.]]

Since the earliest uses of [[pottery wheel]]s to help shape clay vessels, pottery has had a strong relationship to symmetry. Pottery created using a wheel acquires full rotational symmetry in its cross-section, while allowing substantial freedom of shape in the vertical direction. Upon this inherently symmetrical starting point, potters from ancient times onwards have added patterns that modify the rotational symmetry to achieve visual objectives.

Cast metal vessels lacked the inherent rotational symmetry of wheel-made pottery, but otherwise provided a similar opportunity to decorate their surfaces with patterns pleasing to those who used them. The ancient [[Chinese people|Chinese]], for example, used symmetrical patterns in their bronze castings as early as the 17th century BC. Bronze vessels exhibited both a bilateral main motif and a repetitive translated border design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinavoc.com/arts/handicraft/bronze.htm The Art of Chinese Bronzes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031211185121/http://chinavoc.com/arts/handicraft/bronze.htm |date=2003-12-11 }}.

Symmetry is not restricted to the visual arts. Its role in the history of [[music]] touches many aspects of the creation and perception of music.

====Musical form====

Symmetry has been used as a [[musical form|formal]] constraint by many composers, such as the [[arch form|arch (swell) form]] (ABCBA) used by [[Steve Reich]], [[Béla Bartók]], and [[James Tenney]]. In classical music, Bach used the symmetry concepts of permutation and invariance.&lt;ref&gt;see ("Fugue No. 21," [http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~tas3/wtc/ii21s.pdf pdf] or [http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~tas3/wtc/ii21.html Shockwave])&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pitch structures====
Symmetry is also an important consideration in the formation of [[scale (music)|scale]]s and [[chord (music)|chords]], traditional or [[tonality|tonal]] music being made up of non-symmetrical groups of [[pitch (music)|pitches]], such as the [[diatonic scale]] or the [[major chord]]. [[Symmetrical scale]]s or chords, such as the [[whole tone scale]], [[augmented chord]], or diminished [[seventh chord]] (diminished-diminished seventh), are said to lack direction or a sense of forward motion, are [[ambiguous]] as to the [[Key (music)|key]] or tonal center, and have a less specific [[diatonic functionality]]. However, composers such as [[Alban Berg]], [[Béla Bartók]], and [[George Perle]] have used axes of symmetry and/or [[interval cycle]]s in an analogous way to [[musical key|keys]] or non-[[tonality|tonal]] tonal [[Tonic (music)|center]]s.&lt;ref name=Perle1992&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Symmetry, the twelve-tone scale, and tonality |first=George |last=Perle |authorlink=George Perle |journal=Contemporary Music Review |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=1992 |pages=81–96 |doi=10.1080/07494469200640151}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Perle explains "C–E, D–F♯, [and] Eb–G, are different instances of the same [[interval (music)|interval]] … the other kind of identity. … has to do with axes of symmetry. C–E belongs to a family of symmetrically related dyads as follows:"&lt;ref name=Perle1992/&gt;

Thus in addition to being part of the interval-4 family, C–E is also a part of the sum-4 family (with C equal to 0).&lt;ref name=Perle1992/&gt;

Interval cycles are symmetrical and thus non-diatonic. However, a seven pitch segment of C5 (the cycle of fifths, which are [[enharmonic]] with the cycle of fourths) will produce the diatonic major scale. Cyclic tonal [[chord progression|progressions]] in the works of [[Romantic music|Romantic]] composers such as [[Gustav Mahler]] and [[Richard Wagner]] form a link with the cyclic pitch successions in the atonal music of Modernists such as Bartók, [[Alexander Scriabin]], [[Edgard Varèse]], and the Vienna school. At the same time, these progressions signal the end of tonality.&lt;ref name=Perle1992/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perle1990"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=George Perle |author=Perle, George |year=1990 |title=The Listening Composer |url=https://archive.org/details/listeningcompose00perl |url-access=limited |page=[https://archive.org/details/listeningcompose00perl/page/n31 21] |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-06991-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first extended composition consistently based on symmetrical pitch relations was probably Alban Berg's [[String Quartet (Berg)|''Quartet'', Op. 3]] (1910).&lt;ref name="Perle1990"/&gt;

====Equivalency====

[[Tone row]]s or [[pitch class]] [[Set theory (music)|sets]] which are [[Invariant (music)|invariant]] under [[Permutation (music)|retrograde]] are horizontally symmetrical, under [[Melodic inversion|inversion]] vertically. See also [[Asymmetric rhythm]].

===In quilts===
[[File:kitchen kaleid.svg|thumb|upright=0.65|left|Kitchen [[kaleidoscope]] [[quilt]] block]]

As [[quilt]]s are made from square blocks (usually 9, 16, or 25 pieces to a block) with each smaller piece usually consisting of fabric triangles, the craft lends itself readily to the application of symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://its.guilford.k12.nc.us/webquests/quilts/quilts.htm Quate: Exploring Geometry Through Quilts] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031231031119/http://its.guilford.k12.nc.us/webquests/quilts/quilts.htm |date=2003-12-31 }}.

===In other arts and crafts===

{{Further|Islamic geometric patterns}}

Symmetries appear in the design of objects of all kinds. Examples include [[beadwork]], [[furniture]], [[sand painting]]s, [[knot]]work, [[masks]], and [[musical instruments]]. Symmetries are central to the art of [[M.C. Escher]] and the many applications of [[tessellation]] in art and craft forms such as [[wallpaper]], ceramic tilework such as in [[Islamic geometric patterns|Islamic geometric decoration]], [[batik]], [[ikat]], carpet-making, and many kinds of [[textile]] and [[embroidery]] patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=77–78, 83, 89, 103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symmetry is also used in designing logos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Design a Perfect Logo with Grid and Symmetry|url=https://www.designmantic.com/how-to/how-to-design-a-perfect-logo}}&lt;/ref&gt; By creating a logo on a grid and using the theory of symmetry, designers can organize their work, create a symmetric or asymmetrical design, determine the space between letters, determine how much negative space is required in the design, and how to accentuate parts of the logo to make it stand out.

===In aesthetics===
{{Main|Symmetry (physical attractiveness)}}

The relationship of symmetry to [[aesthetics]] is complex. Humans find [[bilateral symmetry]] in faces physically attractive;&lt;ref name="Grammer1994"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grammer |first1=K. |last2=Thornhill |first2=R. |date=1994 |title=Human (Homo sapiens) facial attractiveness and sexual selection: the role of symmetry and averageness |journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology |location=Washington, D.C. |volume=108 |issue=3 |pages=233–42 |doi=10.1037/0735-7036.108.3.233|pmid=7924253 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it indicates health and genetic fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rhodes |first1=Gillian |last2=Zebrowitz |first2=Leslie, A. |title=Facial Attractiveness - Evolutionary, Cognitive, and Social Perspectives |publisher=[[Ablex]] |year=2002 |isbn=1-56750-636-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones2001"&gt;Jones, B.

===In literature===
Symmetry can be found in various forms in [[literature]], a simple example being the [[palindrome]] where a brief text reads the same forwards or backwards. Stories may have a symmetrical structure, as in the rise:fall pattern of ''[[Beowulf]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1925&amp;context=utk_gradthes | title=Symmetrical Aesthetics of Beowulf | publisher=University of Tennessee, Knoxville | year=2009 |author1=Jenny Lea Bowman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, a '''genus ''g'' surface''' (also known as a '''''g''-torus''' or '''''g''-holed torus''') is a [[Surface (topology)|surface]] formed by the [[connected sum]] of ''g'' many [[torus|tori]]: the interior of a disk is removed from each of ''g'' many tori and the boundaries of the ''g'' many disks are identified (glued together), forming a ''g''-torus. The [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] of such a surface is ''g''.

A genus ''g'' surface is a [[two-dimensional]] [[manifold]]. The [[Surface (topology)#Classification of closed surfaces|classification theorem for surfaces]] states that every [[compact space|compact]] [[connected space|connected]] two-dimensional manifold is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to either the sphere, the connected sum of tori, or the connected sum of [[real projective plane]]s.

==Definition of genus==
{{Main|Genus (mathematics)}}
The genus of a connected orientable surface is an [[integer]] representing the maximum number of cuttings along non-intersecting [[Curve#Topological_curve|closed simple curves]] without rendering the resultant [[manifold]] disconnected.&lt;ref&gt;Munkres, James R. Topology. Vol. 2. Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; It is equal to the number of [[Handle (mathematics)|handles]] on it. Alternatively, it can be defined in terms of the [[Euler characteristic]] ''χ'', via the relationship ''χ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2''g'' for [[Surface_(topology)#Closed_surfaces|closed surfaces]], where ''g'' is the genus. 

The genus (sometimes called the demigenus or Euler genus) of a connected non-orientable closed surface is a positive integer representing the number of [[cross-cap]]s attached to a sphere. Alternatively, it can be defined for a closed surface in terms of the Euler characteristic ''χ'', via the relationship ''χ'' = 2 − ''g'', where ''g'' is the non-orientable genus.

==Genus 0==
An [[orientability|orientable]] surface of genus zero is the [[sphere]] '''''S''&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt;'''. A non-orientable surface of genus zero is the [[disk (mathematics)|disc]].

File:1-ball.svg|A closed disc (with boundary)
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

==Genus 1==
A genus one orientable surface is the ordinary torus. A non-orientable surface of genus one is the [[projective plane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Glen E. | last=Bredon | authorlink=Glen Bredon | title=Topology and Geometry | publisher=Springer-Verlag | year=1993 | isbn=0-387-97926-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elliptic curve]]s over the complex numbers can be identified with genus 1 surfaces. The formulation of elliptic curves as the embedding of a [[torus]] in the [[complex projective plane]] follows naturally from a property of [[Weierstrass's elliptic functions]] that allows elliptic curves to be obtained from the quotient of the [[complex plane]] by a [[fundamental pair of periods|lattice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Genus 2==
The term '''double torus''' is occasionally used to denote a genus 2 surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld |title=Double Torus |urlname=DoubleTorus}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A non-orientable surface of genus two is the [[Klein bottle]].

The [[Bolza surface]] is the most symmetric [[Riemann surface]] of [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]]&amp;nbsp;2, in the sense that it has the largest possible [[conformal map|conformal]] [[automorphism group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bolza|first= Oskar|title=On Binary Sextics with Linear Transformations into Themselves|journal= American Journal of Mathematics|volume= 10|issue= 1|year= 1887|pages= 47–70|jstor=2369402|doi=10.2307/2369402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometry]], the '''Newton–Gauss line''' (or '''Gauss–Newton line''') is the [[Line (geometry)|line]] joining the [[midpoint]]s of the three [[diagonal]]s of a [[complete quadrangle]].

The midpoints of the two diagonals of a [[Convex set|convex]] [[quadrilateral]] with at most two parallel sides are distinct and thus determine a line, the [[Newton line]]. If the sides of such a quadrilateral are extended to form a complete quadrangle, the diagonals of the quadrilateral remain diagonals of the complete quadrangle and the Newton line of the quadrilateral is the Newton–Gauss line of the complete quadrangle.
&lt;!-- Hold until article is revised
The Newton–Gauss line is very similar to the [[Newton line]], which follows the same general [[theorem]] but uses a convex [[quadrilateral]] with at most two parallel sides; this also means instead of having three [[diagonal]]s, it uses the [[midpoint]] of the two [[diagonal]]s in addition to the point which [[Bisection|bisects]] two lines created by connecting the [[midpoint]]s of the opposite sides of the [[quadrilateral]].
--&gt;

== Complete quadrilaterals ==
{{main|Complete quadrilateral}}

Any four lines in [[general position]] (no two lines are parallel, and no three are concurrent) form a [[complete quadrilateral]]. This [[Configuration (geometry)|configuration]] consists of a total of six points, the intersection points of the four lines, with three points on each line and precisely two lines through each point.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266061112_Gauss-Newton_lines_and_eleven_point_conics|title=Gauss–Newton Lines and Eleven Point Conics|last=Alperin|first=Roger C.|date=6 January 2012|website=Research Gate}}&lt;/ref&gt; These six points can be split into pairs so that the [[line segment]]s determined by any pair do not intersect any of the given four lines except at the endpoints. These three line segments are called [[diagonal]]s of the complete quadrilateral.

===Existence of the Newton−Gauss line===
[[File:Labeling for a complete quadrilateral.svg|right|350px|Labels used in proof concerning complete quadrilateral]]
It is a well-known theorem that the three midpoints of the diagonals of a complete quadrilateral are [[collinear]].&lt;ref name=Johson62&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2007|loc=p. 62}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are several proofs of the result based on areas &lt;ref name=Johson62 /&gt; or wedge products&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Dan|last=Pedoe|title=Geometry A Comprehensive Course|year=1988|origyear=1970|publisher=Dover|pages=46–47|isbn=0-486-65812-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, as the following proof, on [[Menelaus's theorem]], due to Hillyer and published in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2007|loc=p. 152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let the complete quadrilateral {{math|''ABCA'B'C' ''}} be labeled as in the diagram with diagonals {{math|''AA' ''}}, {{math|''BB' ''}} and {{math|''CC' ''}} and their respective midpoints, {{mvar|L}}, {{mvar|M}} and {{mvar|N}}. Let the midpoints of {{mvar|BC}}, {{mvar|CA'}} and {{mvar|A'B}} be {{mvar|P}}, {{mvar|Q}} and {{mvar|R}} respectively. Using similar triangles it is seen that {{mvar|QR}} intersects {{mvar|AA'}} at {{mvar|L}}, {{mvar|RP}} intersects {{mvar|BB'}} at {{mvar|M}} and {{mvar|PQ}} intersects {{mvar|CC'}} at {{mvar|N}}. Again, similar triangles provide the following proportions,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{RL}{LQ} = \frac{BA}{AC}, \quad \frac{QN}{NP} = \frac{A'C'}{C'B}, \quad \frac{PM}{MR} = \frac{CB'}{B'A'}.
&lt;/math&gt;
However, the line {{mvar|AB'C'}} intersects the sides of triangle {{mvar|A'BC}}, so by Menelaus's theorem the product of the terms on the right hand sides is −1. Thus, the product of the terms on the left hand sides is also −1 and again by Menelaus's theorem, the points {{mvar|L}}, {{mvar|M}} and {{mvar|N}} are collinear on the sides of triangle {{mvar|PQR}}.

== Applications to cyclic quadrilaterals==

The following are some results that use the Newton–Gauss line of complete quadrilaterals that are associated with [[cyclic quadrilateral]]s, based on the work of Barbu and Patrascu.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2012volume12/FG201212.pdf|title=Some Properties of the Newton–Gauss Line|last=Patrascu|first=Ion|date=|website=Forum Geometricorum|access-date=29 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given any cyclic quadrilateral &lt;math&gt;ABCD&lt;/math&gt;, let point &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be the [[Line–line intersection|point of intersection]] between the two diagonals &lt;math&gt;AC&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;BD&lt;/math&gt;. Extend the diagonals &lt;math&gt;AB&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;CD&lt;/math&gt; until they meet at the point of intersection, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. Let the [[midpoint]] of the [[Line segment|segment]] &lt;math&gt;EF&lt;/math&gt; be &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, and let the midpoint of the segment &lt;math&gt;BC&lt;/math&gt; be &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; (Figure 1).

==== Theorem ====
If the midpoint of the line segment &lt;math&gt;BF&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, the Newton–Gauss line of the complete quadrilateral &lt;math&gt;ABCDEF&lt;/math&gt; and the line &lt;math&gt;PM&lt;/math&gt; determine an angle &lt;math&gt;\angle PMN&lt;/math&gt; equal to &lt;math&gt;\angle EFD&lt;/math&gt;.

===== Proof =====
First show that the [[triangle]]s  &lt;math&gt;\triangle NPM&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\triangle EDF&lt;/math&gt; are [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]].

Since &lt;math&gt;BE \parallel PN&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;FC \parallel PM&lt;/math&gt;, we know &lt;math&gt;\angle NPM = \angle EAC&lt;/math&gt;. Also, &lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac{BE}{PN} \right )&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;= \left ( \frac{FC}{PM} \right ) = 2.&lt;/math&gt;

In the cyclic quadrilateral &lt;math&gt;ABCD&lt;/math&gt;, these [[Equality (mathematics)|equalities]] hold:

&lt;math&gt;\angle EDF = \angle ADF + \angle EDA = \angle ACB + \angle ABC = \angle EAC.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\angle NPM = \angle EDF.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; be the [[Radius|radii]] of the [[Circumscribed circle|circumcircles]] of &lt;math&gt;\triangle EDB&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\triangle FCD&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Apply the [[law of sines]] to the triangles, to obtain:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {BE}{FC}=\frac {2R_1\sin EDB}{2R_2\sin FDC}=\frac {R_1}{R_2}=\frac {2R_1\sin EBD}{2R_2\sin FCD} = \frac{DE}{DF}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;BE = 2PN&lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt;FC = 2PM&lt;/math&gt;, this shows the equality &lt;math&gt;\frac{PN}{PM} = \frac{DE}{DF}.&lt;/math&gt; The similarity of triangles &lt;math&gt;PMN&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;DFE&lt;/math&gt; follows, and &lt;math&gt;\angle NMP = \angle EFD.&lt;/math&gt;

===== Remark =====
If &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the midpoint of the line segment &lt;math&gt;FC&lt;/math&gt;, it follows by the same reasoning that &lt;math&gt;\angle NMQ = \angle EFA.&lt;/math&gt;
[[File:Newton-Gauss_Line_Figure_2_Subtext.png|thumb|''Figure 2:'' Isogonal lines.]]

=== Isogonal lines ===
==== Theorem ====
The line through &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the Newton–Gauss line of the complete quadrilateral &lt;math&gt;ABCDEF&lt;/math&gt; and the line &lt;math&gt;EF&lt;/math&gt; are isogonal lines of &lt;math&gt;\angle BEC&lt;/math&gt;, that is, each line is a [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] of the other about the [[angle bisector]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; (Figure 2)

===== Proof =====
Triangles &lt;math&gt;EDF&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;NPM&lt;/math&gt; are similar by the above argument, so &lt;math&gt;\angle DEF = \angle PNM&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;E'&lt;/math&gt; be the point of intersection of &lt;math&gt;BC&lt;/math&gt; and the line parallel to the Newton–Gauss line &lt;math&gt;NM&lt;/math&gt; through &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt;PN||BE&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;NM||EE'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\angle BEF = \angle PNF&lt;/math&gt;, and  &lt;math&gt;\angle FNM = \angle E'EF&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\angle CEE' = \angle DEF - \angle E'EF = \angle PNM - \angle FNM = \angle PNF = \angle BEF.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Two cyclic quadrilaterals sharing a Newton-Gauss line===

[[File:Newton-Gauss_Line_Subtext_3.1.png|thumb|''Figure 3:'' Showing that the quadrilaterals '''''MPGN''''' and '''''MQHN''''' are cyclic.]]

==== Lemma ====
Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be the [[Projection (linear algebra)|orthogonal projections]] of the point &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; on the lines &lt;math&gt;AB&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;CD&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

The [[quadrilateral]]s &lt;math&gt;MPGN&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;MQHN&lt;/math&gt;are cyclic quadrilaterals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===== Proof =====
&lt;math&gt;\angle EFD = \angle PMN&lt;/math&gt;, as previously shown. The points &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; are the respective [[Circumscribed circle|circumcenters]] of the [[right triangle]]s &lt;math&gt;\triangle BFG&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\triangle EFG&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\angle PGF = \angle PFG&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\angle FGN = \angle GFN&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore,

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \angle PGN + \angle PMN &amp; = (\angle PGF + \angle FGN) + \angle PMN  \\[4pt] &amp; = \angle PFG + \angle GFN + \angle EFD \\[4pt] &amp;= 180^\circ \end{align}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;MPGN&lt;/math&gt; is a cyclic quadrilateral, and by the same reasoning, &lt;math&gt;MQHN&lt;/math&gt; also lies on a circle.

[[File:Newton-Gauss_Line_Figure_3_subtext_2.png|thumb|''Figure 4:'' Showing that the complete quadrilaterals '''''EDGHIJ''''' and '''''ABCDEF''''' have the same Newton–Gauss line.]]

==== Theorem ====
Extend the lines &lt;math&gt;GF&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;HF&lt;/math&gt; to intersect &lt;math&gt;EC&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;EB&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; respectively (Figure 4).

The complete quadrilaterals &lt;math&gt;EFGHIJ&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;ABCDEF&lt;/math&gt; have the same Newton–Gauss line.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===== Proof =====
The two complete quadrilaterals have a shared diagonal, &lt;math&gt;EF&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; lies on the Newton–Gauss line of both quadrilaterals. &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is [[equidistant]] from &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, since it is the [[Circumscribed circle|circumcenter]] of the cyclic quadrilateral &lt;math&gt;EGFH&lt;/math&gt;.

If triangles &lt;math&gt;\triangle GMP&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\triangle HMQ&lt;/math&gt; are [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]], and it will follow that &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; lies on the [[perpendicular bisector]] of the line &lt;math&gt;HG&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the line &lt;math&gt;MN&lt;/math&gt; contains the midpoint of &lt;math&gt;GH&lt;/math&gt;, and is the Newton–Gauss line of &lt;math&gt;EFGHIJ&lt;/math&gt;.

To show that the triangles &lt;math&gt;\triangle GMP&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\triangle HMQ&lt;/math&gt; are congruent, first observe that &lt;math&gt;PMQF&lt;/math&gt; is a [[parallelogram]], since the points &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; are midpoints of &lt;math&gt;BF&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;BC&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

Therefore,

* &lt;math&gt;MP = QF = HQ,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;GP = PF = MQ,&lt;/math&gt; and
* &lt;math&gt;\angle MPF = \angle FQM.&lt;/math&gt;

Also note that

: &lt;math&gt;\angle FPG = 2 \angle PBG = 2 \angle DBA = 2 \angle DCA = 2 \angle HCF = \angle HQF.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence,

: &lt;math&gt;\angle MPG = \angle MPF + \angle FPG = \angle FQM + \angle HQF = \angle HQF + \angle FQM = \angle HQM.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\triangle GMP&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\triangle HMQ&lt;/math&gt; are congruent by SAS.

===== Remark =====
Due to &lt;math&gt;\triangle GMP&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\triangle HMQ&lt;/math&gt; being congruent triangles, their [[Circumscribed circle|circumcircles]] &lt;math&gt;MPGN&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;MQHN&lt;/math&gt; are also [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]].

== History ==
The Newton–Gauss line proof was developed by the two mathematicians it is named after: [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} The initial framework for this theorem is from the work of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], in his previous theorem on the Newton line, in which Newton showed that the center of a conic inscribed in a quadrilateral lies on the Newton–Gauss line.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David|last=Wells|title=The Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Geometry|year=1991|publisher=Penguin Books|page=[https://archive.org/details/penguindictionar0000well/page/36 36]|isbn=978-0-14-011813-1|url=https://archive.org/details/penguindictionar0000well/page/36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theorem of Gauss and Bodenmiller states that the three circles whose diameters are the diagonals of a complete quadrilateral are [[Coaxal circles|coaxal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2007|loc=p. 172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:RG-59.jpg|thumb|right|[[coaxial cable]]]]
In [[geometry]], '''coaxial''' means that two or more three-[[dimension]]al linear forms share a common [[Coordinate axis|axis]]. Thus, it is [[concentric]] in three-dimensional, linear forms.

A [[coaxial cable]], as a common example, is a three-dimensional linear structure. It has a wire [[Conductor (material)|conductor]] in the centre (D), a circumferential outer conductor (B), and an insulating medium called the dielectric (C) separating these two conductors. The outer conductor is usually sheathed in a protective PVC outer jacket (A). All these have a common axis.

The dimension and material of the conductors and insulation determine the cable's characteristic impedance and [[attenuation]] at various frequencies.

In [[loudspeaker]] design, [[coaxial speakers]] are a loudspeaker system in which the individual driver units radiate sound from the same point or axis.

A [[Weapon mount#Coaxial|coaxial weapon mount]] places two weapons on [roughly] the same axis – as the weapons are usually side-by-side or one on top of the other, they are technically par-axial rather than coaxial, however the distances involved mean that they are effectively coaxial as far as the operator is concerned.

      <text bytes="2816" xml:space="preserve">In mathematics, the '''categorical trace''' is a generalization of the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of a matrix.

==Definition==
The trace is defined in the context of a [[symmetric monoidal category]] ''C'', i.e., a category equipped with a suitable notion of a product &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;. (The notation reflects that the product is, in many cases, a kind of a tensor product.) An object ''X'' in such a category ''C'' is called [[dualizable object|dualizable]] if there is another object &lt;math&gt;X^\vee&lt;/math&gt; playing the rôle of a dual object of ''X''. In this situation, the trace of a morphism &lt;math&gt;f: X \to X&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the compositition of the following morphisms:
&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{tr}(f) : 1 \to X \otimes X^\vee \stackrel{f \otimes id} \to X \otimes X^\vee \to 1&lt;/math&gt;
where 1 is the monoidal unit and the extremal morphisms are the coevaluation and evaluation, which are part of the definition of dualizable objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ponto|Shulman|2014|loc=Def. 2.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same definition applies, to great effect, also when ''C'' is a symmetric monoidal ∞-category.

==Examples==
If ''C'' is the category of vector spaces over a fixed field ''k'', the dualizable objects are precisely the finite-dimensional vector spaces, and the trace in the sense above is the morphism
:&lt;math&gt;k \to k&lt;/math&gt;
which is the multiplication by the trace of the endomorphism ''f'' in the usual sense of linear algebra. In this sense, the categorical trace generalizes the linear-algebraic trace.

If ''C'' is the ∞-category of [[chain complex]]es of modules (over a fixed commutative ring ''R''), dualizable objects ''V'' in ''C'' are precisely the [[perfect complex]]es. The trace in this setting captures, for example, the [[Euler characteristic]], which is the alternating sum of the ranks of its terms:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{tr}(id_V) = \sum_i (-1)^i \operatorname {rank} V_i.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ponto|Shulman|2014|loc=Ex. 3.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further applications==

{{harvtxt|Kondyrev|Prikhodko|2018}} have used categorical trace methods to prove an algebro-geometric version of the [[Atiyah–Bott fixed point formula]], an extension of the [[Lefschetz fixed point formula]].

'''Cat's cradle''' is one of the oldest games in recorded human history, and involves creating various [[string figure]]s, either individually or by passing a loop of string back and forth between two or more players. The true origin of the name is debated, though the first known reference is in ''The light of nature pursued'' by [[Abraham Tucker]] in 1768.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/87650.html|title='Cat's Cradle' - the meaning and origin of this phrase|last=Martin|first=Gary|website=Phrasefinder|language=en|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of string, the specific figures, their order, and the names of the figures vary. Independent versions of this game have been found in [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] cultures throughout the world, including in Africa, Eastern Asia, the Pacific Islands, Australia, the Americas, and the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cats-cradle_us_5a3bcd4ae4b0df0de8b062f5|title=Cat's Cradle|last=Zgheib|first=Yara|date=2017-12-21|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://si-siris.blogspot.com/2010/05/cats-cradle.html|title=Cat's Cradle|last=Archives|first=National Anthropological|date=2010-05-13|website=Smithsonian Collections Blog|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Play==
[[File:Eishosai Choki - Cat's Cradle.jpg|thumb|''The lovers, Okiku and Yosuke, play cat’s cradle'', by [[Eishōsai Chōki]] (1804)]]

The game consists of two or more players making a sequence of string figures, each altering the figure made by the previous player. The game begins with one player making the eponymous figure ''Cat's Cradle'' (above). After each figure, the next player manipulates that figure and removes the string figure from the hands of the previous player with one of a few simple motions and tightens the loop to create another figure, for example, ''Diamonds''. ''Diamonds'' might then lead to ''Candles'', for example, and then ''Manger''—an inverted ''Cat's Cradle''—and so on. Most of the core figures allow a choice between two or more subsequent figures: for example, ''Fish in a Dish'' can become ''Cat's Eye'' or ''Manger''. The game ends when a player makes a mistake or creates a dead-end figure, such as ''Two Crowns'', which cannot be turned into anything else.&lt;ref&gt;[[Camilla Gryski|Gryski, Camilla]] (1984). ''Cat's Cradle, Owl's Eyes: A Book of String Games''. Tom Sankey, illustrator. {{ISBN|0688039413}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The game also may be played solo, as is done in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Gryski, Camilla (1985). ''Many Stars &amp; More String Games'', pp. 66–72. Tom Sankey, illustrator. {{ISBN|0-688-05792-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Mma two young women seated by a kotatsu playing cats cradle 55802.jpg|thumb|"Two Young Women Seated by a [[Kotatsu]] Playing Cat's Cradle", [[Suzuki Harunobu]], ca. 1765]]

The origin of the name "cat's cradle" is debated but the first known reference is in ''The light of nature pursued'' by [[Abraham Tucker]] in 1768.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"An ingenious play they call cat's cradle; one ties the two ends of a packthread together, and then winds it about his fingers, another with both hands takes it off perhaps in the shape of a gridiron, the first takes it from him again in another form, and so on alternately changing the packthread into a multitude of figures whose names I forget, it being so many years since I played at it myself."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The name may have come from a corruption of cratch-cradle, or [[manger]] [[bassinet|cradle]]{{#tag:ref|"Nares, under Cratche, an archaic word for manger, deems it to be the origin of the name of this game, which, however, he calls ''scratch-cradle''.

Different [[culture]]s have different names for the game, and often different names for the individual figures. The [[French language|French]] word for manger is ''crèche'', and cattle feed racks are still known as ''cratches''. In [[Russia]] the whole game is called simply, ''the game of string'', and the ''diamonds'' pattern is called ''carpet'', with other pattern names such as ''field'', ''fish'', and ''sawhorse'' for the other figures—a ''cat'' isn't mentioned.&lt;ref name="B&amp;P"&gt;Buchanan, Andrea J. and Peskowitz, Miriam (2007). ''The Daring Book for Girls'', p.277. {{ISBN|978-0-06-147257-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The game may have originated in China.&lt;ref&gt;(1989). ''Anthroquest: the L.S.B. Leakey Foundation news'', Issues 39–46, p.17. The Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[China]] the game is called ''fan sheng'' ({{lang-en|turning rope}}),&lt;ref name="Jay"/&gt; or catch cradle.&lt;ref name="B&amp;P"/&gt; In some regions of the [[United States|U.S.]], this game also is known as ''Jack in the Pulpit''.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, John P. (2010). ''Joyce's Finnegans Wake: The Curse of Kabbalah'', Volume 4, p.301. {{ISBN|978-1-59942-810-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World records==

Geneva Hultenius, Maryann Divona, and Rita Divona completed 21,200 changes of cat's cradles in 21 hours in Chula Vista, California between August 17–18, 1974. The ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]]'' reported it as a world record in the 1975 and 1976 editions.&lt;ref&gt;McWhirter, Norris and McWhirter, Alan Ross (1975). ''Guinness Book of World Records, 1976'', p.459. Revised. {{ISBN|978-0-8069-0014-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jane Muir and Robyn Lawrick completed 22,700 changes of cat's cradles in 21 hours at [[Market Mall|Calgary Market Mall]], Alberta, Canada on August 25, 1976.&lt;ref&gt;McWhirter, Ross (1983). ''Guinness Book of World Records 1979'', p.453. {{ISBN|978-0-8069-0130-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="33218" xml:space="preserve">In [[geometry]], a '''valuation''' is a finitely additive function on a collection of admissible subsets of a fixed set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with values in an abelian [[semigroup]]. 
For example, the [[Lebesgue measure]] is a valuation on finite unions of convex bodies (i.e. non-empty compact convex sets) of Euclidean space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt;. Other examples of valuations  on finite unions of convex bodies are the surface area, the mean width, and the [[Euler characteristic]].

In the geometric setting, often continuity (or smoothness) conditions are imposed on valuations, but there are also purely discrete facets of the theory. In fact, the concept of valuation has its origin in the dissection theory of [[polytope]]s and in particular [[Hilbert's third problem]], which has grown into a rich theory, heavily reliant on advanced tools from abstract algebra.

==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a set and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal S&lt;/math&gt; be a collection of admissible subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. A function &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal S&lt;/math&gt; with values in an abelian semigroup &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''valuation''' if it satisfies 
&lt;math display="block"&gt; \phi(A\cup B)+  \phi(A\cap B) = \phi(A)+ \phi(B)&lt;/math&gt;
whenever &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A\cup B&lt;/math&gt;, and  &lt;math&gt;A\cap B&lt;/math&gt; are elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal S&lt;/math&gt;. 
If &lt;math&gt;\emptyset\in \mathcal S&lt;/math&gt;, then one always assumes &lt;math&gt;\phi(\emptyset)=0&lt;/math&gt;.

===Examples===
Some common examples for the admissible sets &lt;math&gt;\mathcal S&lt;/math&gt; are non-empty compact convex sets (convex bodies) in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt;, compact convex polytopes in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt;, convex cones, and smooth compact polyhedra in a smooth manifold &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.
  
Let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be a finite-dimensional vector space over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal K(V)&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of convex bodies in &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.

* The [[Euler characteristic]] &lt;math&gt;\chi(K)=1&lt;/math&gt; is a valuation on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal K(V)&lt;/math&gt;,  and it extends as a valuation to the collection of finite unions of convex bodies.
* Any [[Lebesgue measure]] on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, restricted to convex bodies, is a valuation on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal K(V)&lt;/math&gt;.
* Among the valuations derived from volume are the [[Mixed volume#Quermassintegrals|intrinsic volumes]],
&lt;math display="block"&gt; V_i(K)= c_{n,i} \left.\frac{d^i}{dt^i}\right|_{t=0} \operatorname{vol}_n(K+tB^n),\qquad i=0,1,\ldots,n,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;c_{n,i}&lt;/math&gt; is a normalizing constant and &lt;math&gt;B^n\subset \mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; is the Euclidean unit ball, and more generally the [[mixed volume]]s (with some entries fixed arbitrarily). 
* The lattice point enumerator &lt;math&gt;G(P)= |\mathbb Z^n\cap P|&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z^n\subset \mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt;  is the integer lattice, is a valuation on lattice polytopes.
* The map &lt;math&gt;K\mapsto h_K&lt;/math&gt;, where 
&lt;math display="block"&gt;h_K(\xi) = \sup_{x\in K} \xi(x) \qquad \text{for } \xi\in V^*,&lt;/math&gt; 
is the [[support function]] of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, is a valuation on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal K(V)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Valuations on convex bodies==
A valuation on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal K(V)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''translation invariant'' if &lt;math&gt;\phi(K+x)=\phi(K)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in V&lt;/math&gt; and all convex bodies &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;K,L&lt;/math&gt; be two convex bodies in &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. After a choice of Euclidean inner product, their [[Hausdorff distance]] &lt;math&gt;d_H(K,L)&lt;/math&gt; is defined by
&lt;math display="block"&gt; d_H(K,L)= \inf\{\varepsilon &gt;0\colon  K\subset L_\varepsilon \text{ and } L\subset K_\varepsilon \},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;K_\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; denotes the &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. Equipped with this metric, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal K(V)&lt;/math&gt; is a locally compact space.

The space of continuous, translation-invariant valuations on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal K(V)&lt;/math&gt; taking values in the complex numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb C&lt;/math&gt;, is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}(V)&lt;/math&gt;.

The topology on &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}(V)&lt;/math&gt; is the topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal K (V)&lt;/math&gt;. Equipped with the norm 
&lt;math display="block"&gt; \|\phi\| = \max\{ |\phi(K)|\colon K\subset B\},&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;B\subset V&lt;/math&gt; is a bounded subset with nonempty interior, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}(V)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Banach space]].

===Homogeneous valuations===
A translation-invariant continuous valuation &lt;math&gt;\phi\in \operatorname{Val}(V)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-homogeneous'' if 
&lt;math display="block"&gt; \phi(\lambda^i K)= \lambda^i\phi(K)&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;\lambda&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K\in \mathcal K(V)&lt;/math&gt;. The subset &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}_i(V)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-homogeneous valuations is a vector subspace of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}(V)&lt;/math&gt;. [[Peter McMullen|McMullen's]] decomposition theorem&lt;ref name="McMullen"&gt;
P. McMullen, ''Continuous translation-invariant valuations on the space of compact convex sets'', Arch. Math. (Basel) '''34''' (1980), no. 4, 377-384&lt;/ref&gt; states that

&lt;math display="block"&gt; \operatorname{Val}(V)= \bigoplus_{i=0}^n \operatorname{Val}_i(V), \qquad n=\dim V.&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, the degree of a homogeneous valuation is always an integer between &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n=\operatorname{dim} V&lt;/math&gt;.

Valuations are not only graded by the degree of homogeneity, but also by the parity with respect to the reflection through the origin, namely
&lt;math display="block"&gt; \operatorname{Val}_i = \operatorname{Val}_i^+ \oplus \operatorname{Val}_i^-,&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;\phi\in \operatorname{Val}_i^\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;  with &lt;math&gt;\epsilon \in \{+,-\}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\phi(- K)= \epsilon \phi(K)&lt;/math&gt; for all convex bodies &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;.
The elements of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}_i^+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}_i^-&lt;/math&gt; are said to be ''even'' and ''odd'', respectively.

It is a simple fact that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}_0(V)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional and spanned by the Euler characteristic &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. consists of the constant valuations on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal K(V)&lt;/math&gt;.

In 1957 [[Hugo Hadwiger|Hadwiger]]&lt;ref name="Hadwiger"&gt;H. Hadwiger, ''Vorlesungen über Inhalt, Oberfläche und Isoperimetrie'', Springer-Verlag, Berlin-Göttingen-Heidelberg, 1957&lt;/ref&gt; proved that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}_n(V)&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;n=\dim V&lt;/math&gt;) coincides with the &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional space of Lebesgue measures on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.

A valuation &lt;math&gt;\phi\in \operatorname{Val}(\mathbb R^n)&lt;/math&gt; is ''simple'' if &lt;math&gt;\phi(K)=0&lt;/math&gt; for all convex bodies with &lt;math&gt;\dim K&lt;n&lt;/math&gt;. [[Rolf Schneider|Schneider]]&lt;ref name="Schneider:Simple"&gt;R. Schneider, ''Simple valuations on convex bodies'', Mathematika '''43''' (1996), no. 1, 32-39.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1996 described all simple valuations on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt;: they are given by &lt;math display="block"&gt;\phi(K)=c\operatorname{vol}(K)+\int_{S^{n-1}}f(\theta)d\sigma_K(\theta),&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;c\in\mathbb C&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f\in C(S^{n-1})&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary odd function  on the unit sphere &lt;math&gt;S^{n-1}\subset \mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_K&lt;/math&gt; is the surface area measure of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, any simple valuation is the sum of an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;- and an &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;-homogeneous valuation. This in turn implies that an &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-homogeneous valuation is uniquely determined by its restrictions to all &lt;math&gt;(i+1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional subspaces.

===Embedding theorems===
The Klain embedding is a linear injection of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}_i^+(V)&lt;/math&gt;, the space of even &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-homogeneous valuations, into the space of continuous sections of a canonical complex line bundle over the Grassmannian &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Gr}_i(V)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional linear subspaces of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. Its construction is based on Hadwiger's characterization&lt;ref name="Hadwiger" /&gt; of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-homogeneous valuations. If &lt;math&gt;\phi\in \operatorname{Val}_i(V)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E\in \operatorname{Gr}_i(V)&lt;/math&gt;, then the restriction &lt;math&gt;\phi|_E&lt;/math&gt; is an element &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}_i(E)&lt;/math&gt;, and  by Hadwiger's theorem  it is a Lebesgue measure. 
Hence
&lt;math display="block"&gt;\operatorname{Kl}_\phi(E)= \phi|_E&lt;/math&gt;
defines a continuous section of the line bundle over &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Gr}_i(V)&lt;/math&gt; with fiber over &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; equal to the &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional space &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Dens}(E)&lt;/math&gt; of [[Density on a manifold|densities]] (Lebesgue measures) on &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem''' (Klain&lt;ref name="Klain"&gt;D. A. Klain, ''A short proof of Hadwiger's characterization theorem'', Mathematika 42 (1995), no. 2, 329-339.&lt;/ref&gt;). The linear map &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Kl}\colon \operatorname{Val}_i^+(V)\to C(\operatorname{Gr}_i(V),\operatorname{Dens}(E))&lt;/math&gt; is injective.

A different injection, known as the Schneider embedding, exists for odd valuations. It is based on Schneider's description of simple valuations.&lt;ref name="Schneider:Simple" /&gt; It is a linear injection of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}_i^-(V)&lt;/math&gt;, the space of odd &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-homogeneous valuations, into a certain quotient of the space of continuous sections of a line bundle over the partial flag manifold of cooriented pairs &lt;math&gt;(F^i\subset E^{i+1})&lt;/math&gt;. Its definition is reminiscent of the Klain embedding, but more involved. Details can be found in.&lt;ref name="Alesker:Book"&gt;S. Alesker, ''Introduction to the theory of valuations''. CBMS Regional Conference Series in Mathematics, 126. Published for the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences, Washington, DC; by the American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Goodey-Weil embedding is a linear injection of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}_i&lt;/math&gt; into the space of distributions on the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-fold product of the &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimenionsal sphere. It is nothing but the [[Schwartz kernel theorem|Schwartz kernel]] of a natural polarization that any &lt;math&gt;\phi\in\operatorname{Val}_k(V)&lt;/math&gt; admits, namely as a functional on the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-fold product of &lt;math&gt;C^2(S^{n-1})&lt;/math&gt;, the latter space of functions having the geometric meaning of differences of support functions of smooth convex bodies. For details, see.&lt;ref name="Alesker:Book" /&gt;

===Irreducibility Theorem===
The classical theorems of Hadwiger, Schneider and McMullen give fairly explicit descriptions of valuations that are homogeneous of degree  &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;n=\operatorname{dim} V&lt;/math&gt;. But for degrees &lt;math&gt;1&lt;i&lt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; very little was known before the turn of the 21st century. McMullen's conjecture is the statement that the valuations 
&lt;math display="block"&gt;\phi_A(K)=\operatorname{vol}_n(K+A), \qquad A\in\mathcal K(V),&lt;/math&gt;
span a dense subspace of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}(V)&lt;/math&gt;. McMullen's conjecture was confirmed by [[Semyon Alesker|Alesker]] in a much stronger form, which became known as the Irreducibility Theorem:

'''Theorem''' (Alesker&lt;ref name="Alesker:Irred"&gt;S. Alesker, ''Description of translation invariant valuations on convex sets with solution of P. McMullen's conjecture''. Geom. Funct. Anal. '''11''' (2001), no. 2, 244–272.&lt;/ref&gt;). For every  &lt;math&gt;0\leq i\leq n&lt;/math&gt;,  the natural action of &lt;math&gt;GL(V)&lt;/math&gt; on the spaces &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}_i^+(V)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}_i^-(V)&lt;/math&gt; is irreducible.

Here the action of the [[general linear group]] &lt;math&gt;GL(V)&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}(V)&lt;/math&gt; is given by 
&lt;math display="block"&gt; (g\cdot \phi)(K)= \phi(g^{-1} K).&lt;/math&gt;
The proof of the Irreducibility Theorem is based on the embedding theorems of the previous section and [[Beilinson-Bernstein localization]].

===Smooth valuations===
A valuation &lt;math&gt;\phi\in\operatorname{Val}(V)&lt;/math&gt; is called ''smooth'' if the map &lt;math&gt;g\mapsto g\cdot \phi&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;GL(V)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}(V)&lt;/math&gt; is smooth. In other words, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is smooth if and only if &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a smooth vector of the natural representation of &lt;math&gt;GL(V)&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}(V)&lt;/math&gt;. The space of smooth valuations &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}^\infty(V)&lt;/math&gt; is dense in &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}(V)&lt;/math&gt;; it comes equipped with a natural Fréchet-space topology, which is finer than the one induced from &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}(V)&lt;/math&gt;.

For every (complex-valued) smooth function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Gr}_i(\mathbb R^n)&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math  display="block" &gt;\phi(K)=\int_{\operatorname{Gr}_i(\mathbb R^n)} \operatorname{vol}_i(P_E K) f(E) dE,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;P_E\colon \mathbb R^n\to E&lt;/math&gt; denotes the orthogonal projection and &lt;math&gt;dE&lt;/math&gt; is the Haar measure, defines a smooth even valuation of degree &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. It follows from the Irreducibility Theorem, in combination with the Casselman-Wallach theorem, that any smooth even valuation can be represented in this way. Such a representation is sometimes called a ''Crofton formula''.

For any (complex-valued) smooth [[differential form]] &lt;math&gt;\omega\in \Omega^{n-1}(\mathbb R^n\times S^{n-1})&lt;/math&gt; that is invariant under all the translations &lt;math&gt;(x,u)\mapsto (x+t,u)&lt;/math&gt; and every number &lt;math&gt;c\in \mathbb C&lt;/math&gt;,  integration over the ''normal cycle'' defines a smooth valuation:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math  display="block"&gt;  \phi(K)= c\operatorname{vol}_n(K) + \int_{N(K)} \omega, \qquad K\in \mathcal K(\mathbb R^n). &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
As a set, the normal cycle &lt;math&gt;N(K)&lt;/math&gt; consists of the outward unit normals to &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. The Irreducibility Theorem implies that every smooth valuation  is of this form.

==Operations on translation-invariant valuations==
There are several natural operations defined on the subspace of  smooth valuations &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}^\infty(V)\subset \operatorname{Val}(V)&lt;/math&gt;. The most important one is the product of two smooth valuations. Together with pullback and pushforward, this operation extends to valuations on manifolds.

===Exterior product===
Let &lt;math&gt;V,W&lt;/math&gt; be finite-dimensional real vector spaces. 
There exists a bilinear map, called the exterior product, 
&lt;math  display="block"&gt; \boxtimes \colon \operatorname{Val}^\infty(V)\times \operatorname{Val}^\infty(W)\to \operatorname{Val}(V\times W) &lt;/math&gt;
which is uniquely characterized by the following two properties: 
*it is continuous with respect to the usual topologies on &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}^\infty&lt;/math&gt;.
* if &lt;math&gt;\phi=\operatorname{vol}_V(\bullet + A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi= \operatorname{vol}_W(\bullet + B)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;A\in \mathcal K(V)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B\in \mathcal K(W)&lt;/math&gt; are convex bodies with smooth boundary and strictly positive Gauss curvature, and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{vol}_V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{vol}_W&lt;/math&gt; are densities on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, then 
&lt;math  display="block"&gt; \phi\boxtimes \psi = (\operatorname{vol}_V\boxtimes \operatorname{vol}_W) (\bullet + A\times B).&lt;/math&gt;

===Product===
The product of two smooth valuations &lt;math&gt;\phi,\psi\in\operatorname{Val}^\infty (V)&lt;/math&gt; is defined by 
&lt;math display="block"&gt; (\phi\cdot \psi)(K)= (\phi\boxtimes \psi)(\Delta(K)),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta \colon V\to V\times V&lt;/math&gt; is the diagonal embedding. The product is a continuous map 
&lt;math display="block"&gt; \operatorname{Val}^\infty (V) \times  \operatorname{Val}^\infty (V)  \to  \operatorname{Val}^\infty (V) .&lt;/math&gt;
Equipped with this product, &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Val}^\infty (V) &lt;/math&gt; becomes a commutative associative graded algebra with the Euler characteristic as the multiplicative identity.

===Alesker-Poincaré duality===
By a theorem of Alesker, the restriction of the product 
&lt;math display="block"&gt;\operatorname{Val}_k^\infty(V)\times \operatorname{Val}_{n-k}^\infty(V)\to \operatorname{Val}_n^\infty(V)=\operatorname{Dens}(V)&lt;/math&gt; is a non-degenerate pairing. This motivates the definition of the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-homogeneous ''generalized valuation'', denoted &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}_k^{-\infty}(V)&lt;/math&gt;, as &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}^\infty_{n-k}(V)^*\otimes\operatorname{Dens}(V)&lt;/math&gt;, topologized with the weak topology. By the Alesker-Poincaré duality, there is a natural dense inclusion &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}_k^\infty(V)\hookrightarrow\operatorname{Val}_k^{-\infty}(V)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Convolution===
Convolution is a natural product on &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}^\infty(V)\otimes \operatorname{Dens}(V^*)&lt;/math&gt;. For simplicity, we fix a density &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{vol}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; to trivialize the second factor. Define for fixed &lt;math&gt;A,B\in\mathcal K(V)&lt;/math&gt; with smooth boundary and strictly positive Gauss curvature 
&lt;math display="block"&gt;\operatorname{vol}(\bullet+A)\ast\operatorname{vol}(\bullet+B)=\operatorname{vol}(\bullet+A+B).&lt;/math&gt; There is then a unique extension by continuity to a map 
&lt;math display="block"&gt; \operatorname{Val}^\infty (V) \times  \operatorname{Val}^\infty (V)  \to  \operatorname{Val}^\infty (V),&lt;/math&gt; called the convolution.
Unlike the product, convolution respects the co-grading, namely if &lt;math&gt;\phi\in\operatorname{Val}^\infty_{n-i}(V)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\psi\in\operatorname{Val}^\infty_{n-j}(V)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\phi\ast\psi\in \operatorname{Val}^\infty_{n-i-j}(V)&lt;/math&gt;.

For instance, let &lt;math&gt;V(K_1,\ldots, K_n)&lt;/math&gt; denote the mixed volume of the convex bodies &lt;math&gt;K_1,\ldots, K_n\subset \mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt;. If convex bodies &lt;math&gt;A_1,\dots,A_{n-i}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; with  a smooth boundary and strictly positive Gauss curvature   are fixed, then 
&lt;math&gt; \phi(K) = V(K[i], A_1,\dots,A_{n-i})&lt;/math&gt;
defines a smooth valuation of degree &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. The convolution two such valuations is
&lt;math display="block"&gt;V(\bullet[i], A_1,\dots,A_{n-i})\ast V(\bullet[j],B_1,\dots,B_{n-j})=c_{i,j}V(\bullet[n-j-i], A_1,\dots,A_{n-i},B_1,\dots,B_{n-j}),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;c_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; is a constant depending only on &lt;math&gt;i,j,n&lt;/math&gt;.

===Fourier transform===
The Alesker-Fourier transform is a natural, &lt;math&gt;GL(V)&lt;/math&gt;-equivariant isomorphism of complex-valued valuations 
&lt;math  display="block"&gt;\mathbb F: \operatorname{Val}^\infty(V)\to \operatorname{Val}^\infty(V^*)\otimes \operatorname{Dens}(V),&lt;/math&gt; discovered by Alesker and enjoying many properties resembling the classical Fourier transform, which explains its name.

It reverses the grading, namely  &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F: \operatorname{Val}_k^\infty(V)\to \operatorname{Val}^\infty_{n-k}(V^*)\otimes \operatorname{Dens}(V)&lt;/math&gt;, and intertwines the product and the convolution: &lt;math display="block"&gt;\mathbb F(\phi\cdot \psi)=\mathbb F\phi\ast\mathbb F\psi.&lt;/math&gt;

Fixing for simplicity a Euclidean structure to identify &lt;math&gt;V=V^*&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Dens}(V)=\mathbb C&lt;/math&gt;, we have the identity &lt;math display="block"&gt;\mathbb F^2\phi(K)=\phi(-K).&lt;/math&gt; On even valuations, there is a simple description of the Fourier transform in terms of the Klain embedding: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Kl}_{\mathbb F\phi}(E)=\operatorname{Kl}_\phi(E^\perp)&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, even real-valued valuations remain real-valued after the Fourier transform.

For odd valuations, the description of the Fourier transform is substantially more involved. Unlike the even case, it is no longer of purely geometric nature. For instance, the space of real-valued odd valuations is not preserved.

===Pullback and pushforward===
Given a linear map &lt;math&gt;f:U\to V&lt;/math&gt;, there are induced operations of pullback &lt;math&gt;f^*:\operatorname{Val}(V)\to \operatorname{Val}(U)&lt;/math&gt; and pushforward &lt;math&gt;f_*:\operatorname{Val}(U)\otimes\operatorname{Dens}(U)^*\to \operatorname{Val}(V)\otimes \operatorname{Dens}(V)^*&lt;/math&gt;. The pullback is the simpler of the two, given by &lt;math&gt;f^*\phi(K)=\phi(f(K))&lt;/math&gt;. It evidently preserves the parity and degree of homogeneity of a valuation.  
Note that the pullback does not preserve smoothness when &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is not injective.

The pushforward is harder to define formally. For simplicity, fix Lebesgue measures on &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. The pushforward can be uniquely characterized by describing its action on valuations of the form &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{vol}(\bullet+A)&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;A\in \mathcal K(U)&lt;/math&gt;, and then extended by continuity to all valuations using the Irreducibility Theorem. For a surjective map &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, 
&lt;math display="block"&gt;f_*\operatorname{vol}(\bullet+A)=\operatorname{vol}(\bullet+f(A)).&lt;/math&gt; For an inclusion &lt;math&gt;f:U\hookrightarrow V&lt;/math&gt;, choose a splitting &lt;math&gt;V=U\oplus W&lt;/math&gt;. Then 
&lt;math display="block"&gt; f_*\operatorname{vol}(\bullet + A) (K)= \int_{W}\operatorname{vol}(K\cap (U+w) + A) dw.&lt;/math&gt;
Informally, the pushforward is dual to the pullback with respect to the Alesker-Poincaré pairing: for &lt;math&gt;\phi\in \operatorname{Val}(V)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\in\operatorname{Val}(U)\otimes\operatorname{Dens}(U)^*&lt;/math&gt;, 
&lt;math display="block"&gt;\langle f^*\phi,\psi\rangle =\langle \phi, f_*\psi\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;
However, this identity has to be carefully interpreted since the pairing is only well-defined for smooth valuations. For further details, see.&lt;ref name="Alesker:Fourier"&gt;S. Alesker, ''A Fourier-type transform on translation-invariant valuations on convex sets''. Israel J. Math. '''181''' (2011), 189–294&lt;/ref&gt;

==Valuations on manifolds==
In a series of papers beginning in 2006, Alesker laid down the foundations for a theory of valuations on manifolds that extends the theory of valuations on convex bodies. The key observation leading to this extension is that  via integration over the normal cycle ({{EquationNote|1}}), a smooth translation-invariant valuation may be evaluated on  sets  much more general than convex ones. Also ({{EquationNote|1}}) suggests to define  smooth valuations in general by dropping the requirement that the form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; be translation-invariant and by replacing the translation-invariant Lebesgue measure with an arbitrary smooth measure.

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be an n-dimensional smooth manifold and let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb P_X= \mathbb P_+(T^* X)&lt;/math&gt; be the co-sphere bundle of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the oriented projectivization of the cotangent bundle. 
Let  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal P(X)&lt;/math&gt; denote the collection of compact differentiable polyhedra in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.  The normal cycle &lt;math&gt;N(A)\subset \mathbb P_X&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;A\in \mathcal P(X)&lt;/math&gt;, which consists of the outward co-normals to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, is naturally a Lipschitz submanifold of dimension &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt;.

For ease of presentation we henceforth assume that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is oriented, even though the concept of smooth valuations in fact does not depend on orientability.  The space of smooth valuations &lt;math&gt;\mathcal V^\infty(X)&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; consists of functions  &lt;math&gt;\phi\colon \mathcal  P(X)\to \mathbb C&lt;/math&gt; of the form
&lt;math display="block"&gt; \phi(A)= \int_A\mu + \int_{N(A)}\omega,\qquad A\in \mathcal P(X),&lt;/math&gt;
where  &lt;math&gt;\mu\in\Omega^n(X)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega\in \Omega^{n-1}(\mathbb P_X)&lt;/math&gt;  can be arbitrary. 
It was shown by Alesker that the smooth valuations on open subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; form a soft sheaf over &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

===Examples=== 
The following are examples of smooth valuations on a smooth manifold &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;:
* Smooth measures on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.
* The [[Euler characteristic]]; this follows from the work of [[Shiing-Shen Chern|Chern]]&lt;ref&gt;S.-S. Chern, ''On the curvatura integra in a Riemannian manifold''.
Ann. of Math. (2) '''46''' (1945), 674–684.&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Gauss-Bonnet theorem]], where such &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;  were constructed to represent the Euler characteristic. In particular, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is then the [[Chern–Gauss–Bonnet theorem|Chern-Gauss-Bonnet integrand]], which is the Pfaffian of the Riemannian curvature tensor.
* If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is Riemannian, then the Lipschitz-Killing valuations or intrinsic volumes  &lt;math&gt;V_0^X=\chi, V_1^X, \ldots, V_n^X=\mathrm{vol}_X&lt;/math&gt;  are smooth valuations. If &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to \mathbb R^m&lt;/math&gt; is any [[Embedding|isometric immersion]] into a Euclidean space, then &lt;math&gt; V_i^X= f^* V_i^{\mathbb R^m},&lt;/math&gt;  where &lt;math&gt;V_i^{\mathbb R^m}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the usual intrinsic volumes on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^m&lt;/math&gt; (see below for the definition of the pullback).  The existence of these valuations is the essence of Weyl's tube formula.&lt;ref&gt;H. Weyl, ''On the Volume of Tubes''. Amer. J. Math. '''61''' (1939), no. 2, 461–472&lt;/ref&gt;
* Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb C P^n&lt;/math&gt; be the [[complex projective space]], and let &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Gr}_k^\mathbb C&lt;/math&gt; denote the Grassmannian of all complex projective subspaces of fixed dimension &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. The function 
&lt;math display="block"&gt;\phi(A) = \int_{\mathrm{Gr}_k^\mathbb C} \chi(A\cap E) dE, \qquad A\in \mathcal P (\mathbb C P^n),&lt;/math&gt; where the integration is with respect to the Haar probability measure on &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Gr}_k^\mathbb C&lt;/math&gt;, is a smooth valuation. This follows from the work of  Fu.&lt;ref name="Fu:Kinematic"&gt;J. H. G. Fu, ''Kinematic formulas in integral geometry''. Indiana Univ. Math. J. '''39''' (1990), no. 4, 1115-1154&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filtration===
The space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal V^\infty(X)&lt;/math&gt; admits no natural grading in general, however it carries a canonical filtration 
&lt;math display="block"&gt;\mathcal V^\infty(X)= W_0\supset W_1\supset \cdots \supset W_n.&lt;/math&gt; Here &lt;math&gt;W_n&lt;/math&gt; consists of the smooth measures on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;W_j&lt;/math&gt; is given by forms &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; in the ideal generated by &lt;math&gt;\pi^*\Omega^j(X)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\pi:\mathbb P_X\to X&lt;/math&gt; is the canonical projection.

The associated graded vector space &lt;math&gt;\bigoplus_{i=0}^n W_i/W_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; is canonically isomorphic to the space of smooth sections &lt;math display="block"&gt;\bigoplus_{i=0}^n C^\infty (X, \operatorname{Val}_i^\infty(TX)),&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}_i^\infty(TX)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the vector bundle over &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that the fiber over a point &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Val}_i^\infty(T_x X)&lt;/math&gt;, the space of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-homogeneous smooth translation-invariant valuations on the tangent space &lt;math&gt;T_x X&lt;/math&gt;.

===Product===
The space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal V^\infty(X)&lt;/math&gt; admits a natural product. This product is continuous, commutative, associative, compatible with the filtration:
&lt;math display="block"&gt; W_i\cdot W_j\subset W_{i+j},&lt;/math&gt;
and has the Euler characteristic as the identity element. It also commutes with the restriction to embedded submanifolds, and the diffeomorphism group of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; acts on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal V^\infty(X)&lt;/math&gt; by algebra automorphisms.

For example, if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is Riemannian, the Lipschitz-Killing valuations satisfy 
&lt;math display="block"&gt; V_i^X\cdot V_j^X= V_{i+j}^X.&lt;/math&gt;

The Alesker-Poincaré duality still holds. For compact &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; it says that the pairing &lt;math&gt; \mathcal V^\infty(X)\times \mathcal V^\infty(X)\to \mathbb C&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(\phi, \psi)\mapsto (\phi\cdot\psi) (X)&lt;/math&gt; is non-degenerate. As in the translation-invariant case, this duality can be used to define generalized valuations. Unlike the translation-invariant case, no good definition of continuous valuations exists for valuations on manifolds.

The product of valuations closely reflects the geometric operation of intersection of subsets.
Informally, consider the generalized valuation &lt;math&gt;\chi_A=\chi(A\cap\bullet)&lt;/math&gt;. The product is given by &lt;math&gt;\chi_A\cdot\chi_B=\chi_{A\cap B}&lt;/math&gt;. Now one can obtain smooth valuations by averaging generalized valuations of the form &lt;math&gt;\chi_A&lt;/math&gt;, more precisely &lt;math&gt;\phi(X)=\int_S \chi_{s(A)}ds&lt;/math&gt; is a smooth valuation if  &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a sufficiently large measured family of diffeomorphisms. Then one has 
&lt;math display="block"&gt;\int_S \chi_{s(A)}ds\cdot \int_{S'} \chi_{s'(B)}ds'=\int_{S\times S'} \chi_{s(A)\cap s'(B)}dsds',&lt;/math&gt;
see.&lt;ref&gt;J. H. G. Fu, ''Intersection theory and the Alesker product''. Indiana Univ. Math. J. '''65''' (2016), no. 4, 1347–1371.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pullback and pushforward===
Every smooth immersion &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; of smooth manifolds induces a pullback map &lt;math&gt;f^*\colon \mathcal V^\infty(Y) \to \mathcal V^\infty(X)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is an embedding, then 
&lt;math display="block"&gt; (f^* \phi)(A) = \phi(f(A)), \qquad A\in\mathcal P (X).&lt;/math&gt;
The pullback is a morphism of filtered algebras.
Every smooth proper submersion &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; defines  a pushforward map  &lt;math&gt;f^*\colon \mathcal V^\infty(X) \to \mathcal V^\infty(Y)&lt;/math&gt; by 
&lt;math display="block"&gt; (f_* \phi)(A) = \phi(f^{-1}(A)), \qquad A\in\mathcal P (Y).&lt;/math&gt;  The pushforward is compatible with the filtration as well: &lt;math&gt;f_*:W_i(X)\to W_{i-(\dim X-\dim Y)}(Y)&lt;/math&gt;.
For general smooth maps, one can define pullback and pushforward for generalized valuations under some restrictions.

==Applications in Integral Geometry==
Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be a Riemannian manifold and let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a Lie group of isometries of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; acting transitively on the sphere bundle &lt;math&gt;SM&lt;/math&gt;. Under these assumptions the space   &lt;math&gt;\mathcal V^\infty(M)^G&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-invariant smooth valuations  on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is finite-dimensional; let &lt;math&gt;\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_m&lt;/math&gt; be a basis.  Let &lt;math&gt;A,B\in \mathcal P(M)&lt;/math&gt; be differentiable polyhedra in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. Then integrals of the form &lt;math&gt;\int_G \phi_i(A\cap gB)dg &lt;/math&gt; are expressible as linear combinations of &lt;math&gt;\phi_k(A)\phi_l(B)&lt;/math&gt; with coefficients &lt;math&gt;c_i^{kl}&lt;/math&gt; independent of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;: {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math display="block"&gt; \int_G \phi_i(A\cap gB)dg =  \sum_{k,l=1}^m  c_i^{kl}  \phi_k(A)\phi_l(B),\qquad A,B\in \mathcal P(M).&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}
Formulas of this type are called ''kinematic formulas''. Their existence in this generality was proved by Fu.&lt;ref name="Fu:Kinematic"/&gt; For the three simply connected real space forms, i.e., the sphere, Euclidean space, and hyperbolic space, they go back to [[Wilhelm Blaschke|Blaschke]], [[Luis Santaló|Santaló]], [[Shiing-Shen Chern|Chern]], and  [[Herbert Federer|Federer]].

Describing the kinematic formulas explicitly  is typically a  difficult problem. In fact already in the step from real to complex space forms, considerable difficulties arise and these have  only recently been resolved  by Bernig, Fu, and  Solanes&lt;ref&gt;A. Bernig, J. H. G. Fu, G. Solanes, ''Integral geometry of complex space forms''. Geom. Funct. Anal. '''24''' (2014), no. 2, 403–492.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;A. Bernig, J. H. G. Fu, ''Hermitian integral geometry''. Ann. of Math. (2) '''173''' (2011), no. 2, 907–945.&lt;/ref&gt;
.The key insight responsible for this progress is that the kinematic formulas contain the same information as the algebra of invariant valuations  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal V^\infty(M)^G&lt;/math&gt;. 
For a precise statement, let  &lt;math display="block"&gt;k_G\colon \mathcal V^\infty(M)^G \to \mathcal V^\infty(M)^G\otimes \mathcal V^\infty(M)^G&lt;/math&gt;
be the kinematic operator, i.e., the map determined by the kinematic formulas ({{EquationNote|2}}). Let 
&lt;math display="block"&gt;\operatorname{pd} \colon \mathcal V^\infty(M)^G \to \mathcal V^\infty(M)^{G*}&lt;/math&gt;
denote the Alesker-Poincaré duality, which is a linear isomorphism. Finally let &lt;math&gt;m_G^*&lt;/math&gt; be the adjoint of the product map &lt;math display="block"&gt;m_G\colon \mathcal V^\infty(M)^{G}\otimes \mathcal V^\infty(M)^{G}  \to \mathcal V^\infty(M)^{G}  . &lt;/math&gt; The Fundamental theorem of algebraic integral geometry relating operations on valuations to integral geometry, states that if the Poincaré duality is used to identify &lt;math&gt;\mathcal V^\infty(M)^{G}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal V^\infty(M)^{G*}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;k_G=m_G^*&lt;/math&gt;:

For the moiré interference pattern to appear, the two patterns must not be completely identical, but rather displaced, rotated, or have slightly different pitch.

Moiré patterns appear in many situations. In printing, the printed pattern of dots can interfere with the image. In television and digital photography, a pattern on an object being photographed can interfere with the shape of the light sensors to generate unwanted artifacts. They are also sometimes created deliberately – in [[micrometer]]s they are used to amplify the effects of very small movements.

In physics, its manifestation is the [[Beat (acoustics)|beat phenomenon]] that occurs in many wave interference conditions.

== Etymology ==
The term originates from ''[[Moire (fabric)|moire]]'' (''moiré'' in its French adjectival form), a type of [[textile]], traditionally of [[silk]] but now also of [[cotton]] or [[synthetic fiber]], with a rippled or "watered" appearance. Moire, or "watered textile", is made by pressing two layers of the textile when wet. The similar but imperfect spacing of the threads creates a characteristic pattern which remains after the fabric dries.

In French, the adjective ''moiré'' (in use since at least 1823) derives from the earlier verb ''moirer'', "to produce a watered textile by weaving or pressing". ''Moirer'', in turn, is a variation of the word ''mouaire'' which is an adoption of the English ''[[mohair]]'' (in use since at least 1570). ''[[Mohair]]'' comes from the Arabic ''mukhayyar'' ({{lang|ar|مُخَيَّر}}, {{abbr|lit.|literally}} "chosen"), a cloth made from the wool of the [[Angora goat]]. ''Mukhayyar'' ({{lang|ar|مُخَيَّر}}) descends from ''khayyara'' ({{lang|ar|خيّر}}, {{abbr|lit.|literally}} "he chose"). "Chosen" is meant in the sense of "a choice, or excellent, cloth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Skeat |first=Walter |date=1910 |title=The Concise Dictionary of English Etymology (reprinted 1993) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aDhGlKL3h00C |location= |publisher=Wordsworth Editions |page=289–290 |isbn=9781853263118 |author-link=Walter William Skeat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moiré patterns are often an [[Artifact (observational)|artifact]] of [[Digital image|images]] produced by various [[digital imaging]] and [[computer graphics]] techniques, for example when [[Image scanner|scanning]] a [[halftone]] picture or [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] a checkered plane (the latter being a special case of [[aliasing]], due to [[undersampling]] a fine regular pattern).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scanning Images in Books/Magazines/Newspapers (Moire patterns)|url=http://www.scantips.com/basics06.html|website=www.scantips.com|access-date=2020-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be overcome in texture mapping through the use of [[mipmapping]] and [[anisotropic filtering]].

The drawing on the upper right shows a moiré pattern.  The lines could represent fibers in moiré silk, or lines drawn on paper or on a computer screen. The [[nonlinear]] interaction of the optical patterns of lines creates a real and visible pattern of roughly parallel dark and light bands, the moiré pattern, superimposed on the lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The moiré effect also occurs between overlapping transparent objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Miao|first1=Houxun|last2=Panna|first2=Alireza|last3=Gomella|first3=Andrew A.|last4=Bennett|first4=Eric E.|last5=Znati|first5=Sami|last6=Chen|first6=Lei|last7=Wen|first7=Han|title=A universal moiré effect and application in X-ray phase-contrast imaging|journal=Nature Physics|volume=12|issue=9|pages=830–834|doi=10.1038/nphys3734|year=2016|bibcode=2016NatPh..12..830M|pmc=5063246|pmid=27746823}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an invisible phase mask is made of a transparent polymer with a wavy thickness profile. As light shines through two overlaid masks of similar phase patterns, a broad moiré pattern occurs on a screen some distance away. This phase moiré effect and the classical moiré effect from opaque lines are two ends of a continuous spectrum in optics, which is called the universal moiré effect. The phase moiré effect is the basis for a type of broadband interferometer in x-ray and particle wave applications. It also provides a way to reveal hidden patterns in invisible layers.

===Line moiré===
{{main|Line moiré}}

Line moiré is one type of moiré pattern; a pattern that appears when superposing two transparent layers containing correlated opaque patterns. Line moiré is the case when the superposed patterns comprise straight or curved lines. When moving the layer patterns, the moiré patterns transform or move at a faster speed. This effect is called optical moiré speedup.

More complex [[line moiré]] patterns are created if the lines are curved or not exactly parallel.

===Shape moiré===
{{main|Shape moiré}}

Shape moiré is one type of moiré pattern demonstrating the phenomenon of moiré magnification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

}}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1D shape moiré is the particular simplified case of 2D shape moiré. [[Dimension|One-dimensional]] patterns may appear when superimposing an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] layer containing tiny horizontal [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]] lines on top of a layer containing a complex shape which is periodically repeating along the [[Cartesian coordinate system|vertical axis]].

Moiré patterns revealing complex shapes, or sequences of symbols embedded in one of the layers (in form of periodically repeated compressed shapes) are created with shape moiré, otherwise called ''band moiré'' patterns. One of the most important properties of shape moiré is its ability to magnify tiny shapes along either one or both axes, that is, stretching. A common 2D example of moiré magnification occurs when viewing a [[chain-link fence]] through a second chain-link fence of identical design.  The fine structure of the design is visible even at great distances.

== Calculations ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}

=== Moiré of parallel patterns ===

==== Geometrical approach ====
{{multiple image
| total_width = 320
| align = right
| image1 = Moire parallel.svg
| alt1 = 
| caption1 = The patterns are superimposed in the mid-width of the figure.
| image2 = Moire ecart angulaire.png

| footer = 
}}

Consider two patterns made of parallel and equidistant lines, e.g., vertical lines. The step of the first pattern is {{mvar|p}}, the step of the second is {{math|''p'' + ''δp''}}, with {{math|0 &lt; ''δp'' &lt; ''p''}}.

If the lines of the patterns are superimposed at the left of the figure, the shift between the lines increases when going to the right. After a given number of lines, the patterns are opposed: the lines of the second pattern are between the lines of the first pattern. If we look from a far distance, we have the feeling of pale zones when the lines are superimposed (there is white between the lines), and of dark zones when the lines are "opposed".

The middle of the first dark zone is when the shift is equal to {{math|{{sfrac|''p''|2}}}}. The {{mvar|n}}th line of the second pattern is shifted by {{math|''n δp''}} compared to the {{mvar|n}}th line of the first network. The middle of the first dark zone thus corresponds to
&lt;math display="block"&gt;n \cdot \delta p = \frac{p}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
that is
&lt;math display="block"&gt;n = \frac{p}{2 \delta p}.&lt;/math&gt;
The distance {{mvar|d}} between the middle of a pale zone and a dark zone is
&lt;math display="block"&gt;d = n \cdot (p+\delta p) = \frac{p^2}{2 \delta p}+\frac{p}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
the distance between the middle of two dark zones, which is also the distance between two pale zones, is
&lt;math display="block"&gt;2d = \frac{p^2}{\delta p}+p&lt;/math&gt;
From this formula, we can see that:
* the bigger the step, the bigger the distance between the pale and dark zones;
* the bigger the discrepancy {{mvar|δp}}, the closer the dark and pale zones; a great spacing between dark and pale zones mean that the patterns have very close steps.

The principle of the moiré is similar to the [[Vernier scale]].

==== Mathematical function approach ====
[[File:Moiré grid.svg|thumb|upright|Moiré pattern (bottom) created by superimposing two grids (top and middle)]]

The essence of the moiré effect is the (mainly visual) perception of a distinctly different third pattern which is caused by inexact superimposition of two similar patterns. The mathematical representation of these patterns is not trivially obtained and can seem somewhat arbitrary. In this section we shall give a mathematical example of two parallel patterns whose superimposition forms a moiré pattern, and show one way (of many possible ways) these patterns and the moiré effect can be rendered mathematically.

The visibility of these patterns is dependent on the medium or substrate in which they appear, and these may be opaque (as for example on paper) or transparent (as for example in plastic film). For purposes of discussion we shall assume the two primary patterns are each printed in greyscale ink on a white sheet, where the opacity (e.g., shade of grey) of the "printed" part is given by a value between 0 (white) and 1 (black) inclusive, with {{sfrac|1|2}} representing neutral grey. Any value less than 0 or greater than 1 using this grey scale is essentially "unprintable".

We shall also choose to represent the opacity of the pattern resulting from printing one pattern atop the other at a given point on the paper as the average (i.e. the arithmetic mean) of each pattern's opacity at that position, which is half their sum, and, as calculated, does not exceed 1. (This choice is not unique. Any other method to combine the functions that satisfies keeping the resultant function value within the bounds [0,1] will also serve; arithmetic averaging has the virtue of simplicity—with hopefully minimal damage to one's concepts of the printmaking process.)

We now consider the "printing" superimposition of two almost similar, sinusoidally varying, grey-scale patterns to show how they produce a moiré effect in first printing one pattern on the paper, and then printing the other pattern over the first, keeping their coordinate axes in register. We represent the grey intensity in each pattern by a positive opacity function of distance along a fixed direction (say, the x-coordinate) in the paper plane, in the form

&lt;math display="block"&gt;f = \frac{1 + \sin(k x)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

where the presence of 1 keeps the function positive definite, and the division by 2 prevents function values greater than 1.

The quantity {{mvar|k}} represents the periodic variation (i.e., spatial frequency) of the pattern's grey intensity, measured as the number of intensity cycles per unit distance. Since the sine function is cyclic over argument changes of {{math|2π}}, the distance increment {{math|Δ''x''}} per intensity cycle (the wavelength) obtains when {{math|''k'' Δ''x'' {{=}} 2π}}, or {{math|Δ''x'' {{=}} {{sfrac|2π|''k''}}}}.

Consider now two such patterns, where one has a slightly different periodic variation from the other:

&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{align}
 f_1 &amp;= \frac{1 + \sin(k_1 x)}{2} \\[4pt]
 f_2 &amp;= \frac{1 + \sin(k_2 x)}{2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

such that {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ ''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

The average of these two functions, representing the superimposed printed image, evaluates as follows:

&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{align} f_3 &amp;= \frac{f_1 + f_2}{2} \\[5pt] &amp;= \frac12 + \frac{\sin(k_1 x) + \sin(k_2 x)}{4} \\[5pt] &amp;= \frac{1 + \sin(A x) \cos(B x)}{2} \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where it is easily shown that

&lt;math display="block"&gt;A = \frac{k_1 + k_2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math display="block"&gt;B = \frac{k_1 - k_2}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This function average, {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}, clearly lies in the range [0,1]. Since the periodic variation {{mvar|A}} is the average of and therefore close to {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the moiré effect is distinctively demonstrated by the sinusoidal envelope "beat" function {{math|cos(''Bx'')}}, whose periodic variation is half the difference of the periodic variations {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} (and evidently much lower in frequency).

Other one-dimensional moiré effects include the classic [[beat (acoustics)|beat]] frequency tone which is heard when two pure notes of almost identical pitch are sounded simultaneously. This is an acoustic version of the moiré effect in the one dimension of time: the original two notes are still present—but the listener's ''perception'' is of two pitches that are the average of and half the difference of the frequencies of the two notes. Aliasing in sampling of time-varying signals also belongs to this moiré paradigm.

=== Rotated patterns ===
Consider two patterns with the same step {{mvar|p}}, but the second pattern is rotated by an angle {{mvar|α}}. Seen from afar, we can also see darker and paler lines: the pale lines correspond to the lines of [[Node (physics)|nodes]], that is, lines passing through the intersections of the two patterns.

If we consider a cell of the lattice formed, we can see that it is a [[rhombus]] with the four sides equal to {{math|''d'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''p''|sin ''α''}}}}; (we have a right [[triangle]] whose hypotenuse is {{mvar|d}} and the side opposite to the angle {{mvar|α}} is {{mvar|p}}).

{{multiple image

| caption1 = Unit cell of the "net"; "''ligne claire''" means "pale line".
| image2 = Moire02.gif
| alt2 = 
| caption2 = Effect of changing angle
| footer = 
}}

The pale lines correspond to the small [[diagonal]] of the rhombus. As the diagonals are the [[Bisection|bisectors]] of the neighbouring sides, we can see that the pale line makes an angle equal to {{math|{{sfrac|''α''|2}}}} with the perpendicular of each pattern's line.

Additionally, the spacing between two pale lines is {{mvar|D}}, half of the long diagonal. The long diagonal {{math|2''D''}} is the hypotenuse of a right triangle and the sides of the right angle are {{math|''d''(1 + cos ''α'')}} and {{mvar|p}}. The [[Pythagorean theorem]] gives:
&lt;math display="block"&gt;(2 D)^2 = d^2 (1 + \cos \alpha)^2 + p^2&lt;/math&gt;
that is:
&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{align} (2D)^2 &amp;= \frac{p^2}{\sin^2 \alpha}(1+ \cos \alpha)^2 + p^2 \\[5pt]
&amp;= p^2 \cdot \left ( \frac{(1 + \cos \alpha)^2}{\sin^2 \alpha} + 1\right) \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
thus
&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{align} (2D)^2 &amp;= 2 p^2 \cdot \frac{1+\cos \alpha}{\sin^2 \alpha} \\[5pt] D &amp;= \frac{\frac{p}{2}}{\sin\frac{\alpha}{2}}. \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

{{multiple image

| image1 = Moire Circles.svg
| alt1 = 
| caption1 = 
| image2 = Moire Lines.svg
| alt2 = 
| caption2 = 
| footer = Effect on curved lines
}}

When {{mvar|α}} is very small ({{math|''α'' &lt; {{sfrac|π|6}}}}) the following [[small-angle approximation]]s can be made:
&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{align} \sin \alpha &amp;\approx \alpha \\ \cos \alpha &amp;\approx 1 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
thus
&lt;math display="block"&gt;D \approx \frac{p}{\alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

We can see that the smaller {{mvar|α}} is, the farther apart the pale lines; when both patterns are parallel ({{math|''α'' {{=}} 0}}), the spacing between the pale lines is infinite (there is no pale line).

There are thus two ways to determine {{mvar|α}}: by the orientation of the pale lines and by their spacing
&lt;math display="block"&gt;\alpha \approx \frac{p}{D}&lt;/math&gt;
If we choose to measure the angle, the final error is proportional to the measurement error. If we choose to measure the spacing, the final error is proportional to the inverse of the spacing. Thus, for the small angles, it is best to measure the spacing.

== Implications and applications ==

=== Printing full-color images ===
[[File:BeatTrackMoirePattern.ogg|thumb|upright=1.5|The product of two "beat tracks" of slightly different speeds overlaid, producing an audible moiré pattern; if the beats of one track correspond to where in space a black dot or line exists and the beats of the other track correspond to the points in space where a camera is sampling light, because the frequencies are not exactly the same and aligned perfectly together, beats (or samples) will align closely at some moments in time and far apart at other times. The closer together beats are, the darker it is at that spot; the farther apart, the lighter. The result is periodic in the same way as a graphic moiré pattern. See: [[phasing (music)|phasing]].]]
In [[graphic arts]] and [[prepress]], the usual technology for printing full-color images involves the superimposition of [[halftone]] screens. These are regular rectangular dot patterns—often four of them, printed in cyan, yellow, magenta, and black. Some kind of moiré pattern is inevitable, but in favorable circumstances the pattern is "tight"; that is, the spatial frequency of the moiré is so high that it is not noticeable. In the graphic arts, the term ''moiré'' means an ''excessively visible'' moiré pattern. Part of the prepress art consists of selecting screen angles and halftone frequencies which minimize moiré. The visibility of moiré is not entirely predictable. The same set of screens may produce good results with some images, but visible moiré with others.

=== Television screens and photographs ===

Moiré patterns are commonly seen on television screens when a person is wearing a shirt or jacket of a particular weave or pattern, such as a [[houndstooth]] jacket. This is due to interlaced scanning in televisions and non-film cameras, referred to as [[interline twitter]]. As the person moves about, the moiré pattern is quite noticeable. Because of this, newscasters and other professionals who appear on TV regularly are instructed to avoid clothing which could cause the effect.

Photographs of a [[television|TV]] screen taken with a [[digital camera]] often exhibit moiré patterns. Since both the TV screen and the digital camera use a scanning technique to produce or to capture pictures with horizontal scan lines, the conflicting sets of lines cause the moiré patterns. To avoid the effect, the digital camera can be aimed at an angle of 30 degrees to the TV screen.

=== {{Anchor|Inogon light|Inogon leading mark}} Marine navigation ===
The moiré effect is used in shoreside beacons called "Inogon leading marks" or "Inogon lights", manufactured by Inogon Licens AB, Sweden, to designate the safest path of travel for ships heading to locks, marinas, ports, etc., or to indicate underwater hazards (such as pipelines or cables). The moiré effect creates arrows that point towards an imaginary line marking the hazard or line of safe passage; as navigators pass over the line, the arrows on the beacon appear to become vertical bands before changing back to arrows pointing in the reverse direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Patent 4,629,325|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US4629325|website=Google Patents|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alexander Trabas |url=http://www.listoflights.org/leuchtfeuer/detail?id=487 |title=Prohibited anchorage |publisher=Light of Lights |accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hydrographic Dictionary |date=2003 |publisher=[[International Hydrographic Organization]] |location=Monaco |page=113 |edition=5 |chapter=inogen light {{sic}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example can be found in the UK on the East shore of Southampton water, opposite Fawley oil refinery ({{coord|50|51|21.63|N|1|19|44.77|W|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Tom|last=Scott|title=The Moiré Effect Lights That Guide Ships Home|date=5 March 2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d99_h30swtM|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar moiré effect beacons can be used to guide mariners to the centre point of an oncoming bridge; when the vessel is aligned with the centreline, vertical lines are visible.

=== Strain measurement ===
[[File:Moire extensometrie.png|thumb|Use of the moiré effect in strain measurement: case of uniaxial traction (top) and of pure shear (bottom); the lines of the patterns are initially horizontal in both cases]]

In [[manufacturing]] industries, these patterns are used for studying microscopic [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] in materials: by deforming a grid with respect to a reference grid and measuring the moiré pattern, the stress levels and patterns can be deduced. This technique is attractive because the scale of the moiré pattern is much larger than the deflection that causes it, making measurement easier.

The moiré effect can be used in [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] measurement: the operator just has to draw a pattern on the object, and superimpose the reference pattern to the [[Deformation (engineering)|deformed]] pattern on the deformed object.

A similar effect can be obtained by the superposition of a [[Hologram|holographic]] image of the object to the object itself: the hologram is the reference step, and the difference with the object are the deformations, which appear as pale and dark lines.

=== Image processing ===
Some [[image scanner]] [[computer program]]s provide an optional [[Filter (software)|filter]], called a "descreen" filter, to remove Moiré-pattern artifacts which would otherwise be produced when scanning printed [[halftone]] images to produce digital images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scantips.com/basics6c.html|title=Scanning Images in Magazines/Books/Newspapers|website=ScanTips.com|accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Banknotes ===
Many [[banknote]]s exploit the tendency of digital scanners to produce moiré patterns by including fine circular or wavy designs that are likely to exhibit a moiré pattern when scanned and printed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Sincerbox |editor1-first=Glenn T. |title=Counterfeit deterrent features for the next-generation currency design |date=1991 |publisher=National Materials Advisory Board |location=Washington DC |isbn=9780309050289 |page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[super-resolution microscopy]], the moiré pattern can be used to obtain images with a resolution higher than the diffraction limit, using a technique known as [[super resolution microscopy#Structured illumination microscopy (SIM)|structured illumination microscopy]].&lt;ref name="SIMicroscopy" /&gt;

In [[Scanning tunneling microscope|scanning tunneling microscopy]], moiré fringes appear if surface atomic layers have a different [[crystal structure]] than the bulk crystal. This can for example be due to [[surface reconstruction]] of the crystal, or when a thin layer of a second crystal is on the surface, e.g. single-layer,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kobayashi|first=Katsuyoshi|date=1996-01-01|title=Moiré pattern in scanning tunneling microscopy: Mechanism in observation of subsurface nanostructures|journal=Physical Review B|volume=53|issue=16|pages=11091–11099|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.53.11091|pmid=9982681|bibcode=1996PhRvB..5311091K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=N’Diaye|first=Alpha T.|date=2006-01-01|title=Two-Dimensional Ir Cluster Lattice on a Graphene Moiré on Ir(111)|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=97|issue=21|pages=215501|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.215501|pmid=17155746|arxiv=cond-mat/0609286|bibcode=2006PhRvL..97u5501N|s2cid=19791195}}&lt;/ref&gt; double-layer [[graphene]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=K.

In condensed matter physics, the moiré phenomenon is commonly discussed for [[two-dimensional materials]]. The effect occurs when there is mismatch between the lattice parameter or angle of the 2D layer and that of the underlying substrate,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; or another 2D layer, such as in 2D material heterostructures.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The phenomenon is exploited as a means of engineering the electronic structure or optical properties of materials,&lt;ref name="LiuWeiss2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Yuan|last2=Weiss|first2=Nathan O.|last3=Duan|first3=Xidong|last4=Cheng|first4=Hung-Chieh|last5=Huang|first5=Yu|last6=Duan|first6=Xiangfeng|title=Van der Waals heterostructures and devices|journal=Nature Reviews Materials|volume=1|issue=9|pages=16042|year=2016|issn=2058-8437|doi=10.1038/natrevmats.2016.42|bibcode=2016NatRM...116042L}}&lt;/ref&gt; which some call moiré materials. The often significant changes in electronic properties when twisting two atomic layers and the prospect of electronic applications has lead to the name [[twistronics]] of this field. A prominent example is in twisted bi-layer [[graphene]], which forms a moiré pattern and at a particular ''magic angle'' exhibits superconductivity and other important electronic properties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://physics.aps.org/articles/v12/12 APS Physics - Trend: Bilayer Graphene's Wicked, Twisted Road]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[materials science]], known examples exhibiting moiré contrast are e.g. [[thin film]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yin|first1=Xi|last2=Liu|first2=Xinhong|last3=Pan|first3=Yung-Tin|last4=Walsh|first4=Kathleen A.|last5=Yang|first5=Hong|date=10 December 2014|title=Hanoi Tower-like Multilayered Ultrathin Palladium Nanosheets|journal=Nano Letters|volume=14|issue=12|pages=7188–7194|bibcode=2014NanoL..14.7188Y|doi=10.1021/nl503879a|pmid=25369350}}&lt;/ref&gt; or nanoparticles of MX-type (M = Ti, Nb; X = C, N) overlapping with austenitic matrix. Both phases, MX and the matrix, have face-centered cubic crystal structure and cube-on-cube orientation relationship. However, they have significant lattice misfit of about 20 to 24% (based on the chemical composition of alloy), which produces a moiré effect.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Clear}}

'''Geological perspective correlation''' is a theory in [[geology]] describing geometrical regularities in the layering of sediments. Seventy percent of the Earth's surface are occupied by [[sedimentary basins]]&lt;ref name = Watts&gt;Watts, A.B., The Formation of Sedimentary Basins. In "Understanding the Earth", Chapter 15, Cambridge University Press., 1992&lt;/ref&gt; – volumes consisted of [[sediments]] accumulated during million years, and alternated by long interruptions in sedimentation (hiatuses). The most noticeable feature of the [[rocks]], which filled the basins, is layering ([[Stratum|stratification]]).&lt;ref&gt; "stratification | geology". Encyclopedia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stratigraphy]] is a part of Geology that investigates the phenomenon of layering. It describes the sequence of layers in the basin as consisted of [[stratigraphic units]]. Units are defined on the basis of their lithology and have no clear definition.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 5. Lithostratigraphic Units". International Commission on Stratigraphy. 2013–2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Geological Perspective Correlation (GPC) is a theory that divided the geological cross-section in units according strong mathematical rule: all borders of layers in this unit obey the law of [[perspective (geometry)|perspective geometry]]. &lt;ref&gt;Young, John Wesley (1930), Projective Geometry, The Carus Mathematical Monographs (#4), Mathematical Association of America&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[[Sedimentation]] layers are mainly created in shallow waters of oceans, seas, and lakes. As new layers are deposited the old ones are sinking deeper due to the weight of accumulating sediments.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Philip A.; John R. Allen (2008). Basin analysis : principles and applications (2. ed., [Nachdr.] ed.). Malden, MA [u.a.]: Blackwell. &lt;/ref&gt; The content of sedimentary layers (lithological and biological), their order in the sequence, and  geometrical characteristics keep records of the history of the [[Earth]], of past [[climate]], sea-level and environment&lt;ref name = Watts&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Most knowledge about the [[sedimentary basins]] came from exploration drilling when searching for oil and gas. The essential feature of this information is that each layer is penetrated by the wells in a number of scattered locations. This raises the problem of identifying each layer in all wells – the geological correlation problem&lt;ref name=succession&gt;Van Wagoner J., Mitchum R., Campion, K. and Rahmanian V. Siliciclastic Sequence Stratigraphy in Well Logs, Cores, and Outcrops: Concepts for High-Resolution Correlation of Time and Facies AAPG Methods in Exploration Series, No. 7, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The identification is based on comparison of 1) physical and mineralogical characteristics of the particular layer (lithostratigraphy), or 2) petrified remnants in this layer (biostratigraphy).&lt;ref&gt; Kearey, Philip (2001). Dictionary of Geology (2nd ed.) London, New York, etc.: Penguin Reference, London, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; The similarity of layers is decreasing as the distance between the cross-sections increases that leads to ambiguity of the correlation scheme that indicates which layers penetrated at different locations belong to the same body (see A). To improve the results geologists take in consideration the spatial relations between layers, which restricted the number of acceptable correlations. The first restriction was formulated in XVII century: the sequence of layers is the same in any cross-section.  The second one was discovered by Haites in 1963&lt;ref name=Haites&gt;T. Binnert Heites. (1963). Perspective correlation. APG Bulletin vol. 47, N 4. &lt;/ref&gt;: In an undisturbed sequence of layers (strata) the thicknesses (H1 and H2) of any layer observed in two different locations obey the law of [[perspective (geometry)|perspective geometry]], i.e the perspective ratio K = H1/H2 is the same for all layers in this succession. This theory attracted attention around the world.&lt;ref name=Miall&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tipper&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, and particularly in Russia &lt;ref name=GubCorr&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Edel&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Salin&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is also a basis of the method of graphical correlation in biostratigraphy widely used in oil and coal industries.&lt;ref name=Shaw &gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nemec&gt;Nemec W.

How Oil Drilling Works. https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/oil-drilling.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Drilling gives the most detailed information about the position, thickness, physical, chemical and biological characteristics of each layer, but the point is that each well presents all this information in one location on the layer. Because the geometry of a layer can be very complicated it becomes a difficult problem and requires a significant number of drilled wells.
The challenge is identifying in each well the interval that belongs to the same layer now or in the past&lt;ref&gt;Voronin, Y.A., Methodological issues of application of mathematical methods and computers in geology. Published by the Computer Center, Siberian Division of the USSR Academy of Sciences. Novosibirsk, Yakutsk: 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; (see A). To do this geologists use all available characteristics of the layer. Only after this it is possible to begin the recovery of the geometry of the layer (to be more precise – the geometry of the top and bottom surfaces of the layer). This procedure is called geological correlation&lt;ref name=succession&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, and the results are presented as a[[Lithostratigraphy|correlation scheme]] (A). It is natural that at the beginning of the exploration, when the number of wells is small, the correlation scheme contains expensive mistakes.&lt;ref name = Randle&gt;Randle C.,  Bond C.,  Lark M.,  Monaghan A.

== Basics of geological correlation == 
The Danish scientist Nicolas Steno (1638–1686) is credited with three principles of sedimentation&lt;ref&gt; Steno, Nicolas (1916). Nicolas Steno's Dissertation Concerning a Solid Body Enclosed by Process of Nature within a Solid: An English Version with an Introduction and Explanatory Notes. Translated by Winter, John. New York, The Macmillan company; London, Macmillan and company, limited.|pages=229–230&lt;/ref&gt;
# superposition: in undeformed stratigraphic sequences the oldest strata will be at the bottom of the succession,
# original horizontality: layers of sediment are originally deposited horizontally,
# lateral continuity: layers of sediments initially extend laterally in all directions.
The principles 1 allows defining the temporary relations between neighboring geological bodies, the principle 2 organizes the geometrical pattern of the succession of layers, the principle 3 helps uniting the parts of the layer found in separated geological cross-sections.
Practical correlation has a lot of difficulties: fuzzy borders of the layers, variations in composition and structure of the rocks in the layer, unconformities in the sequence of layers, etc. This is why errors in correlation schemes are not seldom.&lt;ref name = Randle&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; When the distances between available cross-sections are decreasing (for example, by drilling new wells) the quality of correlation is improving, but meanwhile the wrong geological decisions could be made that increases the expenses of geological projects. From Steno's principle of initial horizontality follows that the top borders of the layers (tops) were initially flat, and remained flat until the complete succession stays undisturbed by subsequent tectonic movements, but no regularities about the geometric relations between these flat surfaces in the succession were known. The first to shed light on the problem was Canadian geologist Binner Heites: in 1963 he published the Geological Perspective Correlation hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Haites&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Perspective geological correlation is a theory that establishes strong geometrical restrictions on the geometry of the layers in sedimentary deposits.

==Perspective geometry in undisturbed succession of layers ==
[[File:Haites perspective correlation.png|thumb| (B) Heites' perspective correlation]] [[File:W Fig 4.png|thumb|(C) Correlation plot]]
In 1963 the Canadian geologist Binner Heites discovered a strong regularity of the layering in [[sedimentary basins]]: the thicknesses of layers within each [[stratigraphic unit]] are governed by the law of  [[perspective (geometry)|perspective correspondence]]. &lt;ref name=Haites&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It means that in undisturbed succession on the correlation scheme  the straight lines drawn through the border points of the same layer in two cross-sections intersect in one point – ''center of perspectivity'' (see B). 
For geological purposes more convenient geometrical presentation of perspective relations is the correlation plot proposed by Jekhowsky&lt;ref&gt;Jekhowsky, B. de, La methode des distances minimales, nouveau procede quantitative de correlation stratigraphique, exemple d'application on paleontologie. ''Rev. Inst. Franç. Du Petrole'', Paris, 1963, vol. XVIII, No. 5, 629–653.&lt;/ref&gt; (see C): the depths of the layer's borders in one geologic cross-section are plotted along axis h′ (h1′, h2′, h3′,...), and the position of the same layers in another  cross-section are plotted along axis h′′ (h1′′, h2′′, h3′′, ...). Points 1, 2, 3 …  with coordinates (h1′, h1′′), (h2′, h2′′), and (h3′, h3′′), accordingly, are called ''correlation points'', and a curve drawn through these points, a ''correlation line''. Black dots (''connectors'') represent the relative position of correlated borders on the plot. When the layers geometry satisfies the conditions of perspective correspondence the correlation line is a straight line. In the particular case of parallel layers  the inclination of the ''correlation line'' is 45&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;. 
The Perspective Geological Correlation also states that 
#each [[sedimentary basin]] consists of a number of [[stratigraphic units]] (sequence of layers without [[unconformities]]), and
#in each unit the relations between the thicknesses of the layers in two cross-sections  satisfy the perspective geometry conditions with individual ratios K.

Heites also concludes that all [[strata]] in each unit were governed by the same rate of deposition, and their borders are synchronous time-planes.  Each layer has different thicknesses in different locations, but they lasted equally long. It was a significant input in [[chronostratigraphy]].

The following are consequences of the basic statements:&lt;br&gt;
#  In different stratigraphic horizons the slopes of the correlation lines are different.  
# If two adjacent sections have the same slope then both sections belong to the same stratigraphic horizon.  The gap between the lines indicates a fault.    
# If on the correlation line that presents the undisturbed stratigraphic succession one correlation point doesn't fit the line it means that&lt;br&gt;a) the correlation of the tops of the corresponding layer is wrong, or&lt;br&gt;       b) lithologic replacement.

== Connections to traditional lithostratigraphy == 
The Perspective Geological Correlation is well grounded in traditional [[geology]]. The method of convergence maps serves for determining the structure of the layer based on the known structure of the layers lying above. It is based on the assumption that the layers are close to parallel.&lt;ref&gt;Hain, B.E., and Lomidze, M.G., 1995, Geotectonica s osnovami geodinamiki ( Geotectonics with basics of geodynamics): Moscow State University, Moscow, 480&lt;/ref&gt; Convergence map shows lines of equal distance ([[Isopach map|isopach lines]]) between key layer and target layer.&lt;ref&gt;Tearpock, Daniel J. and Bischke, Richard E. (2002), Applied Subsurface Geological Mapping with Structural Methods (2nd Edition), Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs 822 p.&lt;/ref&gt; If the layers are parallel the distance between these layers is constant,  the structures of both layers are identical, and to determine depths of the target horizon it is enough to get only one deep well, which reached the target layer.  But in reality such conditions are extremely rare. In reality restoring the geometry of the target horizon demands a number of deep wells in the area. In this case the standard procedure for calculating the distance between the target layer and key layer ''in any point'' in the area is linear interpolation between the known wells.&lt;ref&gt;Yang Q. &amp; Bursik M. A new interpolation method to model thickness, isopachs, extent, and volume of tephra fall deposits. Bulletin of Volcanology volume  78, article number 68 (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The reliability of the result (the geometrical structure of the target horizon) is estimated by the analysis of the trend of the distances between key horizon and target horizon (isopachs): if the trend is regular, for example, the distances are monotonically changing in one direction, it is a sign of reliability of the reconstruction. In the simplest case the surface of the target horizon is a [[general position|plain in general position]], and the linear interpolation gives the correct result. The assumptions of the convergence method are consequences of the perspective correlations theory&lt;ref name=Unorthodox&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, so, the method obtains the theoretical background. The theory also gave an additional criteria for the validity of the reconstructed surface. It defines the stratigraphic interval where layers were deposited without interruption, and where the layers' thicknesses satisfy the law of [[perspective (geometry)|perspective geometry]].The convergence maps deliver the correct result only when the layers belong to such stratigraphic unit.

[[File:One stratigraphic unit.png|thumb|left|(D) Correlation plot for two cross-sections in Innisfail field (Alberta. Canada) 6&amp;nbsp;km in thickness—no unconformities]]
	The description of the theory was supplied by a number of cases in support of the theory.&lt;br&gt;
# The plot (D) shows the correlation plot for two wells in Alberta (Canada): Innisfail 15-8-35-1W5 and Innisfail 7-33-25-lW5 . The cross-section of Innisfail field contains a middle Proterozoic to Paleocene sedimentary succession in excess of 6 km in thickness. The graph shows that the relations between thicknesses of all corresponding layers in these two cross-sections are located on the straight line, i.e. submit to the law of geometrical perspective with the same ''perspective ratio'' K. The markers are from conventional correlation scheme.The deviation of the correlation points from the straight line is about 5 feet on average.

Review of article T.B. Heites “Perspective correlation”. Soviet Geology, 1964, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;. It describes in the details the hypothesis and estimates very high its potential. The idea attracted the programmers working on automation of correlation on computers: the known rules of correlation were fuzzy, and it was impossible to formalize them and transform them into algorithms.  The restrictions of the geometry of layering observed by Heites allowed compensating the lack of nonformal human knowledge.&lt;br&gt;
A group of Russian scientists (Guberman, Ovchinnikova, Maximov) positively tested Heites' hypothesis in different oil-bearing province using the computer program (in Central Asia, Volga-Ural province, West and East Siberia, and Russian Platform)&lt;ref name=GubCorr&gt;Guberman, Sh.A., and Ovchinnikova, M.

Since the publication of Heites' theory in 1963 it was republished in a number of reviews on quantitative methods of correlation (including automatic correlation)&lt;ref name=Miall&gt;Miall E.

Techniques for quantitative stratigraphic correlation: a review and annotated bibliography. Geol. Mag. 125 (5), 1988, pp. 475–494&lt;/ref&gt;. Some of the reports (Hansen, Salin, Barinova) demonstrate that the perspective correlation allowed to achieve better reconstruction of the geological structure at the early stages of geological exploration. Hansen&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;Hansen H . (1969). A Geometric Method to Subdivide the Patapsco Formation of Southern Maryland into Informal Mapping Units for Hydrogeologic Use. GSA Bulletin (1969) 80 (2): 329–336.: https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/gsabulletin/article-pdf/80/2/329/3428126/i0016-7606-80-2-329.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; describes the controversial history of investigating the complicated  Patapsco formation in Maryland and Virginia (USA), and claims that “an adaptation of Heites' (1963) technique of perspective correlation is used to subdivide the Patapsco Formation into consistently defied mapping units”. Salin was able to simplify the stratigraphic description of Khatyr depression (Siberia) by applying perspective correlation&lt;ref name=Salin&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

Because of the high resolving power of the method it was recognized the existence of a number of geological faults that break the leakproofness. Because of small displacements of the faults they were not found by the traditional methods of correlation, and rejected by the geological service of the project.

In 1964 Shaw proposed the method of correlating fossiliferous stratigraphic profiles using the two-axis graph (H) &lt;ref name= Shaw &gt;Shaw, A. B., 1964, Time in Stratigraphy: New York, McGraw-Hill, 365 p. &lt;/ref&gt;. The markers on each axis are the observed depths of lowest (FAD) and highest (LAD) occurrences of a specially defined group of fossils ([[taxon|taxa]]).  The appearances/ disappearances of taxa are regarded as synchronous and used as markers of correlation. When projected on a graph, the corresponding points of two compared profiles form the Line of Correlation (LOC).  Shaw showed that the ideal LOC consists of linear segments (H).  Such conditions occur when the number of collected fossils is big, and one can be sure that the material covers the complete range of fossils appearance, and FADs and LADs can be accurately determined. In the reality, some sampled ranges will be shorter than true ranges, and this can disturb the linearity of the LOC.  

In every stratigraphic interval correlated ends of the range (FAD or LAD) belong to the same time surface, and in each geological cross-section (well or outcrop) this interval has identical duration but different thickness. It means that accumulation rates (thickness-to-duration ratio = tg β) are different in different locations. From the fact that the relation of durations of the units and their thicknesses are linear follows that in the limits of the linear section of LOC all strata have the same accumulation rate. 

The reliability and accuracy of Shaw's method have been tested by Edwards&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;Edwards, L.E. (1984) Insights on why graphic correlation (Shaw's method) works. Journal Geology 92: 583–597. &lt;/ref&gt;, using a computer simulation on hypothetical data sets, and by Rubel and Pak&lt;ref&gt; Rubel, M. and Pak, D.N. (1984) Theory of stratigraphic correlation by means of ordinal scales. Computers Geosciences 10:43–57.&lt;/ref&gt;in terms of the formal logic and stochastic theory.

The graphical correlation became a very important tool of stratigraphy in coal and oil industries.

In 1988 Nemec showed the equivalence of Haites' perspective correlation, and Shaw's graphical correlation&lt;ref name=Nemec&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the theory of perspective correlation in 1986 S. Guberman proposed a model of the process of [[sedimentation]]&lt;ref name=Unorthodox&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guberman S. Informal analysis in geology and geophysics. Moscow, Nedra, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;According Haites’ theory in the given sedimentary basin in each stratigraphic unit the condition of perspective correspondence are satisfied in any pair of wells&lt;ref name=Haites&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  From this follows that the tops and bases of the layers in this [[stratigraphic unit]] satisfy the conditions of perspective correspondence in 3-D space (K). Any three points of a plane define the complete plane. It means that if in three wells  the thicknesses of layers belonging to the same stratigraphic unit are known, then the thicknesses of these layers can be calculated for any location in the basin. Accordingly, if the structure of the top border of the stratigraphic unit is known, the structure of any other border in this unit can be calculated.
The model of creating such sophisticated geometrical pattern is based on the first Steno's principle: the strata are originally horizontal, i.e. are planes. It occurs in the shallow waters due to the turbulence of the undersurface layer of water. The second Steno's principle, which indicates the creation of a series of sedimentary layers lying on top of each others, supposes the subsidence of the basin. The sinking of the basin follows the strong geometrical restrictions: the tectonic bloc, which carry the basin, is rotating around the straight line parallel to the water surface, and located  onshore (L). As a result, until the moment of main tectonic disturbance all borders of the layers remain flat and the geometrical inter-relations are described as perspective correspomdence. In the future the tectonic movements will distort the shape of the layers – the borders will no more be planes, but in majority of cases the changes are smooth and the perspective relations are maintained.
This model allows specifying some geological terms. The Steno's horizontality principle has to state: the top surface of the sediments is horizontal.The conformity is a fundamental notion in stratigraphy. Until now this term is used in two different meanings: a surface between two stratigraphic sequances, and the relationship between two stratigraphic units. Sometimes both were used in the same paragraph (see &lt;ref&gt;Shanmugan G. Origin, Recognition, and Importance of Erosional Unconformities in Sedimentary Basins. (In: Ed. K.L. Kleinspehn, . C. Paola . New Perspectives in Basin Analysis.  Springer, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;, page 84).Perspective correlation principle allows to define the notion of conformity: sequence of layers that obey the conditions of geometrical perspective is a unit of conformity. Two neighboring units of conformity are in relation of unconformity.  &lt;br&gt;
	Here is an example that shows that the borders of undisturbed stratigraphic unit in the Middle Carboniferous  (Volga-Ural oil province, Russia) initially were plains. In the central part of the area (about 100 km in diameter) were chosen three wells at distances of 10 – 15 km..  The three tops of the stratigraphic unit  in the three wells are points in 3D space with coordinates  x, y, z, where x and y are present the position of the well on the surface (M), and z is the thickness of the stratigraphic unit  in this location. They  determine the top plain of the unit as it was at the time of its creation. The three bases determine the bottom plane of the unit at it was at the same time.  This allowed calculateing the thickness of the stratigraphic unit at any point in the area. Because the area was well enough drilled the calculated numbers can be compared with the real numbers. The average difference equals 2%.

      <text bytes="4557" xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], and especially [[algebraic geometry]], a '''Bridgeland stability condition''', defined by [[Tom Bridgeland]], is an algebro-geometric stability condition defined on elements of a [[triangulated category]]. The case of original interest and particular importance is when this derived category is the [[derived category]] of [[coherent sheaves]] on a [[Calabi–Yau manifold]], and this situation has fundamental links to [[string theory]] and the study of [[D-brane]]s.

Such stability conditions were introduced in a rudimentary form by [[Michael_R._Douglas|Michael Douglas]] called &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt;-stability and used to study [[Bogomol'nyi–Prasad–Sommerfield_state|BPS]] B-branes in string theory.&lt;ref name=douglas&gt;Douglas, M.R., Fiol, B. and Römelsberger, C., 2005. Stability and BPS branes. Journal of High Energy Physics, 2005(09), p. 006.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was made precise by Bridgeland, who phrased these stability conditions categorically, and initiated their study mathematically.&lt;ref name=bridgeland&gt;Bridgeland, T., 2007. Stability conditions on triangulated categories. Annals of Mathematics, pp. 317–345.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The definitions in this section are presented as in the original paper of Bridgeland, for arbitrary triangulated categories.&lt;ref name=bridgeland /&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; be a triangulated category. A '''slicing''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; is a collection of full additive [[subcategory|subcategories]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;\varphi\in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(\varphi)[1] = \mathcal{P}(\varphi+1)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;[1]&lt;/math&gt; is the shift functor on the triangulated category,
* if &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1 &gt; \varphi_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A\in \mathcal{P}(\varphi_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B\in \mathcal{P}(\varphi_2)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}(A,B)=0&lt;/math&gt;, and
* for every object &lt;math&gt;E\in \mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; there exists a finite sequence of real numbers &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1&gt;\varphi_2&gt;\cdots&gt;\varphi_n&lt;/math&gt; and a collection of triangles 
:::[[File:HN Filtration in triangulated category.png|frameless|600px|left]]{{Clear}}
:with &lt;math&gt;A_i\in \mathcal{P}(\varphi_i)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

The last property should be viewed as axiomatically imposing the existence of [[Stable_vector_bundle#Harder–Narasimhan_filtration|Harder–Narasimhan filtrations]] on elements of the category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;.

A '''Bridgeland stability condition''' on a triangulated category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; is a pair &lt;math&gt;(Z,\mathcal{P})&lt;/math&gt; consisting of a slicing &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; and a group homomorphism &lt;math&gt;Z: K(\mathcal{D}) \to \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;K(\mathcal{D})&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Grothendieck group]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, called a '''central charge''', satisfying
* if &lt;math&gt;0\ne E\in \mathcal{P}(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;Z(E) = m(E) \exp(i\pi \varphi)&lt;/math&gt; for some strictly positive real number &lt;math&gt;m(E) \in \mathbb{R}_{&gt; 0}&lt;/math&gt;.

It is convention to assume the category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Category_(mathematics)#Small_and_large_categories|essentially small]], so that the collection of all stability conditions on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; forms a set &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Stab}(\mathcal{D})&lt;/math&gt;. In good circumstances, for example when &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D} = \mathcal{D}^b \operatorname{Coh}(X)&lt;/math&gt; is the derived category of coherent sheaves on a complex manifold &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, this set actually has the structure of a complex manifold itself.

It is shown by Bridgeland that the data of a Bridgeland stability condition is equivalent to specifying a bounded [[t-structure]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(&gt;0)&lt;/math&gt; on the category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; and a central charge &lt;math&gt;Z: K(\mathcal{A})\to \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; on the heart &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} = \mathcal{P}((0,1])&lt;/math&gt; of this t-structure which satisfies the Harder–Narasimhan property above.&lt;ref name=bridgeland /&gt; An element &lt;math&gt;E\in\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is '''semi-stable''' (resp. '''stable''') with respect to the stability condition &lt;math&gt;(Z,\mathcal{P})&lt;/math&gt; if for every surjection &lt;math&gt;E \to F&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;F\in \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\varphi(E) \le (\text{resp.}&lt;) \, \varphi(F)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;Z(E) = m(E) \exp(i\pi \varphi(E))&lt;/math&gt; and similarly for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

== Definition ==

In this section we present the dHYM equation as explained in the mathematical literature by Collins-Xie-[[Shing-Tung Yau|Yau]].&lt;ref name=col1&gt;Collins, T.C., XIIE, D. and YAU, S.T.G., 2018. The Deformed Hermitian–Yang–Mills Equation in Geometry and Physics. Geometry and Physics: Volume 1: A Festschrift in Honour of Nigel Hitchin, 1, p.69.&lt;/ref&gt; The deformed Hermitian–Yang–Mills equation is a fully non-linear partial differental equation for a [[Hermitian metric]] on a [[line bundle]] over a [[Compact space|compact]] [[Kähler manifold]], or more generally for a real [[Complex differential form|&lt;math&gt;(1,1)&lt;/math&gt;-form]]. Namely, suppose &lt;math&gt;(X,\omega)&lt;/math&gt; is a Kähler manifold and &lt;math&gt;[\alpha] \in H^{1,1}(X,\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; is a class. The case of a line bundle consists of setting &lt;math&gt;[\alpha]=c_1(L)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;c_1(L)&lt;/math&gt; is the first [[Chern class]] of a [[holomorphic line bundle]] &lt;math&gt;L\to X&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\dim X = n&lt;/math&gt; and consider the topological constant
:&lt;math&gt;\hat z([\omega], [\alpha]) = \int_X (\omega + i \alpha)^n.&lt;/math&gt;
Notice that &lt;math&gt;\hat z&lt;/math&gt; depends only on the class of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\hat z\ne 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then this is a complex number
:&lt;math&gt;\hat z([\omega], [\alpha]) = r e^{i \theta}&lt;/math&gt;
for some real &lt;math&gt;r&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and angle &lt;math&gt;\theta\in [0,2\pi)&lt;/math&gt; which is uniquely determined.

Fix a smooth representative [[differential form]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in the class &lt;math&gt;[\alpha]&lt;/math&gt;. For a smooth function &lt;math&gt;\phi: X \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; write &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{\phi} = \alpha + i \partial \bar \partial \phi&lt;/math&gt;, and notice that &lt;math&gt;[\alpha_{\phi}] = [\alpha]&lt;/math&gt;. The '''deformed Hermitian Yang–Mills equation''' for &lt;math&gt;(X,\omega)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;[\alpha]&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}\operatorname{Im}(e^{-i\theta} (\omega + i \alpha_{\phi})^n) = 0\\ 
\operatorname{Re}(e^{-i\theta} (\omega + i \alpha_{\phi})^n) &gt; 0.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The second condition should be seen as a [[Positive form|positivity]] condition on solutions to the first equation. That is, one looks for solutions to the equation &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Im}(e^{-i\theta} (\omega + i \alpha_{\phi})^n) = 0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Re}(e^{-i\theta} (\omega + i \alpha_{\phi})^n) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. This is in analogy to the related problem of finding [[Kähler-Einstein metric]]s by looking for metrics &lt;math&gt;\omega + i \partial \bar \partial \phi&lt;/math&gt; solving the Einstein equation, subject to the condition that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a Kähler potential (which is a positivity condition on the form &lt;math&gt;\omega + i \partial \bar \partial \phi&lt;/math&gt;).

=== Relation to Hermitian Yang–Mills equation ===

The dHYM equations can be transformed in several ways to illuminate several key properties of the equations. First, simple algebraic manipulation shows that the dHYM equation may be equivalently written
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Im}((\omega+i\alpha)^n)=\tan \theta \operatorname{Re}((\omega+i\alpha)^n).&lt;/math&gt;
In this form, it is possible to see the relation between the dHYM equation and the regular [[Hermitian Yang–Mills equation]]. In particular, the dHYM equation should look like the regular HYM equation in the so-called large volume limit. Precisely, one replaces the Kähler form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;k\omega&lt;/math&gt; for a positive integer &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, and allows &lt;math&gt;k\to \infty&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that the phase &lt;math&gt;\theta_k&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;(X,k\omega,[\alpha])&lt;/math&gt; depends on &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. In fact, &lt;math&gt;\tan \theta_k = O(k^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;, and we can expand
:&lt;math&gt;(k\omega + i \alpha)^n = k^n \omega^n + i n k^{n-1} \omega^{n-1}\wedge \alpha + O(k^{n-2}).&lt;/math&gt;
Here we see that 
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Re}((k\omega + i \alpha)^n) = k^n \omega^n + O(k^{n-2}),\quad \operatorname{Im}((k\omega + i \alpha)^n) = nk^{n-1} \omega^{n-1}\wedge \alpha + O(k^{n-3}),&lt;/math&gt;
and we see the dHYM equation for &lt;math&gt;k\omega&lt;/math&gt; takes the form
:&lt;math&gt;C k^{n-1} \omega^n + O(k^{n-3}) = n k^{n-1} \omega^{n-1} \wedge \alpha + O(k^{n-3})&lt;/math&gt;
for some topological constant &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; determined by &lt;math&gt;\tan \theta&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we see the leading order term in the dHYM equation is
:&lt;math&gt;n\omega^{n-1}\wedge \alpha = C \omega^n&lt;/math&gt;
which is just the HYM equation (replacing &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;F(h)&lt;/math&gt; if necessary).

=== Local form ===

The dHYM equation may also be written in local coordinates. Fix &lt;math&gt;p\in X&lt;/math&gt; and holomorphic coordinates &lt;math&gt;(z^1,\dots,z^n)&lt;/math&gt; such that at the point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, we have
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \sum_{j=1}^n i dz^j \wedge d\bar z^j,\quad \alpha = \sum_{j=1}^n \lambda_j i dz^j \wedge d\bar z^j.&lt;/math&gt;
Here &lt;math&gt;\lambda_j \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; as we assumed &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; was a real form. Define the '''Lagrangian phase operator''' to be
:&lt;math&gt;\Theta_{\omega}(\alpha) = \sum_{j=1}^n \arctan(\lambda_j).&lt;/math&gt;
Then simple computation shows that the dHYM equation in these local coordinates takes the form
:&lt;math&gt;\Theta_{\omega}(\alpha) = \phi&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\phi = \theta\mod 2\pi&lt;/math&gt;. In this form one sees that the dHYM equation is fully non-linear and elliptic.

== Solutions ==

It is possible to use [[algebraic geometry]] to study the existence of solutions to the dHYM equation, as demonstrated by the work of Collins-Jacob-Yau and Collins-Yau.&lt;ref name=coljacyau&gt;Collins, T.C., Jacob, A. and Yau, S.T., 2015. (1, 1) forms with specified Lagrangian phase: a priori estimates and algebraic obstructions. arXiv preprint arXiv:1508.01934.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=colyau&gt;Collins, T.C. and Yau, S.T., 2018. Moment maps, nonlinear PDE, and stability in mirror symmetry. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.04824.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=colshi&gt;Collins, T.C. and Shi, Y., 2020. Stability and the deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills equation. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.04831.&lt;/ref&gt; Suppose that &lt;math&gt;V\subset X&lt;/math&gt; is any analytic subvariety of dimension &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. Define the '''central charge''' &lt;math&gt;Z_V([\alpha])&lt;/math&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt;Z_V([\alpha]) = -\int_V e^{-i\omega + \alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;
When the dimension of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is 2, Collins-Jacob-Yau show that if &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Im}(Z_X([\alpha]))&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a solution of the dHYM equation in the class &lt;math&gt;[\alpha]\in H^{1,1}(X,\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for every curve &lt;math&gt;C\subset X&lt;/math&gt; we have
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Im}\left(\frac{Z_C([\alpha])}{Z_X([\alpha])}\right)&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=coljacyau /&gt;
In the specific example where &lt;math&gt;X=\operatorname{Bl}_p \mathbb{CP}^n&lt;/math&gt;, the [[blowing up|blow-up]] of [[complex projective space]], Jacob-Sheu show that &lt;math&gt;[\alpha]&lt;/math&gt; admits a solution to the dHYM equation if and only if &lt;math&gt;Z_X([\alpha])\ne 0&lt;/math&gt; and for any &lt;math&gt;V\subset X&lt;/math&gt;, we similarly have
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Im}\left(\frac{Z_V([\alpha])}{Z_X([\alpha])}\right)&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=jacsheu&gt;A. Jacob, and N. Sheu, The deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills equation
on the blow-up of P n, in preparation&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown by Gao Chen that in the so-called supercritical phase, where &lt;math&gt;\frac{(n-2)\pi}{2} &lt; \theta &lt; \frac{n\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, algebraic conditions analogous to those above imply the existence of a solution to the dHYM equation.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, G., 2020. Supercritical deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills equation. arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.12202.&lt;/ref&gt; This is achieved through comparisons between the dHYM and the so-called J-equation in Kähler geometry. The J-equation appears as the *small volume limit* of the dHYM equation, where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon \omega&lt;/math&gt; for a small real number &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and one allows &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\to 0&lt;/math&gt;.

In general it is conjectured that the existence of solutions to the dHYM equation for a class &lt;math&gt;[\alpha] = c_1(L)&lt;/math&gt; should be equivalent to the [[Bridgeland stability]] of the line bundle &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=colyau /&gt;&lt;ref name=colshi /&gt; This is motivated both from comparisons with similar theorems in the non-deformed case, such as the famous [[Kobayashi–Hitchin correspondence]] which asserts that solutions exist to the HYM equations if and only if the underlying bundle is slope stable. It is also motivated by physical reasoning coming from string theory, which predicts that physically realistic B-branes (those admitting solutions to the dHYM equation for example) should correspond to [[Π-stability]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, M.R., Fiol, B. and Römelsberger, C., 2005. Stability and BPS branes. Journal of High Energy Physics, 2005(09), p.006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation to string theory ==

[[Superstring theory]] predicts that spacetime is 10-dimensional, consisting of a [[Lorentzian manifold|Lorentzian]] manifold of dimension 4 (usually assumed to be [[Minkowski space]] or [[De Sitter space|De sitter]] or [[Anti-de Sitter space|anti-De Sitter space]]) along with a [[Calabi-Yau manifold]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of dimension 6 (which therefore has complex dimension 3). In this string theory [[String (physics)#Closed and open strings|open strings]] must satisfy [[Dirichlet boundary conditions]] on their endpoints. These conditions require that the end points of the string lie on so-called D-branes (D for Dirichlet), and there is much mathematical interest in describing these branes. 
[[File:D3-brane et D2-brane.PNG|thumb|Open strings with endpoints fixed on D-branes]]
In the B-model of [[topological string theory]], [[homological mirror symmetry]] suggests D-branes should be viewed as elements of the [[derived category]] of [[coherent sheaves]] on the Calabi-Yau 3-fold &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Aspinwall, P.S., 2005. D-Branes on Calabi-Yau Manifolds. In Progress in String Theory: TASI 2003 Lecture Notes. Edited by MALDACENA JUAN M. Published by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd., 2005. {{ISBN|9789812775108}}, pp. 1-152 (pp. 1-152).&lt;/ref&gt; This characterisation is abstract, and the case of primary importance, at least for the purpose of phrasing the dHYM equation, is when a B-brane consists of a holomorphic submanifold &lt;math&gt;Y\subset X&lt;/math&gt; and a holomorphic vector bundle &lt;math&gt;E\to Y&lt;/math&gt; over it (here &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; would be viewed as the support of the coherent sheaf &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;), possibly with a compatible [[Chern connection]] on the bundle.

This Chern connection arises from a choice of Hermitian metric &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, with corresponding [[Connection (vector bundle)|connection]] &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; and [[curvature form]] &lt;math&gt;F(h)&lt;/math&gt;. Ambient on the spacetime there is also a B-field or [[Kalb–Ramond field]] &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; (not to be confused with the B in B-model), which is the string theoretic equivalent of the classical background [[electromagnetic field]] (hence the use of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, which commonly denotes the magnetic field strength).&lt;ref&gt;Freed, D.S. and Witten, E., 1999. Anomalies in string theory with $ D $-branes. Asian Journal of Mathematics, 3(4), pp.819-852.&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematically the B-field is a [[gerbe]] or [[bundle gerbe]] over spacetime, which means &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; consists of a collection of two-forms &lt;math&gt;B_i \in \Omega^2(U_i)&lt;/math&gt; for an open cover &lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt; of spacetime, but these forms may not agree on overlaps, where they must satisfy [[cocycle condition]]s in analogy with the [[Vector bundle#Transition functions|transition functions]] of line bundles (0-gerbes).&lt;ref&gt;Laine, K., 2009. Geometric and topological aspects of Type IIB D-branes. arXiv preprint arXiv:0912.0460.&lt;/ref&gt; This B-field has the property that when [[Pullback (differential geometry)|pulled back]] along the inclusion map &lt;math&gt;\iota: Y \to X&lt;/math&gt; the gerbe is trivial, which means the B-field may be identified with a globally defined two-form on &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, written &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;. The differential form &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; discussed above in this context is given by &lt;math&gt;\alpha = F(h) + \beta&lt;/math&gt;, and studying the dHYM equations in the special case where &lt;math&gt;\alpha = F(h)&lt;/math&gt; or equivalently &lt;math&gt;[\alpha] = c_1(L)&lt;/math&gt; should be seen as ''turning the B-field off'' or setting &lt;math&gt;\beta = 0&lt;/math&gt;, which in string theory corresponds to a spacetime with no background higher electromagnetic field.

The dHYM equation describes the equations of motion for this D-brane &lt;math&gt;(Y,E)&lt;/math&gt; in spacetime equipped with a B-field &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, and is derived from the corresponding equations of motion for A-branes through mirror symmetry.&lt;ref name=phys1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=phys2 /&gt; Mathematically the A-model describes D-branes as elements of the [[Fukaya category]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, [[special Lagrangian submanifold]]s of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; equipped with a flat unitary line bundle over them, and the equations of motion for these A-branes is understood. In the above section the dHYM equation has been phrased for the D6-brane &lt;math&gt;Y=X&lt;/math&gt;.

Strictly speaking, these transformations act on the ''dual number [[projective line over a ring|projective line]]'', which adjoins to the dual numbers a set of points at infinity. Topologically, this projective line is equivalent to a cylinder. Points on this cylinder are in a natural [[one-to-one correspondence]] with oriented lines on the plane.

== Definition ==

A Laguerre transformation is a function of the form &lt;math&gt;z\mapsto\frac{az + b}{cz + d}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a,b,c,d&lt;/math&gt; are all dual numbers, &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; lies on the dual number projective line, and &lt;math&gt;ad-bc&lt;/math&gt; is not a [[zero divisor]].

A [[dual number]] is a [[hypercomplex number]] of the form &lt;math&gt;x+y\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon^2=0&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\neq0&lt;/math&gt;. This can be compared to the [[complex numbers]] which are of the form &lt;math&gt;x+yi&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;i^2=-1&lt;/math&gt;. The ''dual number projective line'' adjoins to the dual numbers a set of numbers of the form &lt;math&gt;\frac 1 {k\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt; for any [[Real number|real]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.

== Line coordinates ==

A line which makes an angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; with the x-axis, and whose [[x-intercept]] is denoted &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, is represented by the dual number
:&lt;math&gt; z = \tan(\theta/2)(1 + \epsilon s).&lt;/math&gt;

The above doesn't make sense when the line is parallel to the x-axis. In that case, if &lt;math&gt;\theta = \pi&lt;/math&gt; then set &lt;math&gt;z = \frac{-2}{\epsilon R}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[y-intercept]] of the line. This may not appear to be valid, as one is dividing by a zero divisor, but this is a valid point on the projective dual line. If &lt;math&gt;\theta = 2\pi&lt;/math&gt; then set &lt;math&gt;z = \frac 1 2 \epsilon R&lt;/math&gt;.

Finally, observe that these coordinates represent ''oriented'' lines. An oriented line is an ordinary line with one of two possible orientations attached to it. This can be seen from the fact that if &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is increased by &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; then the resulting dual number representative is not the same.

== Matrix representations ==

It's possible to express the above line coordinates as [[homogeneous coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;z = [\sin(\theta/2) + \frac12\epsilon R\cos(\theta/2):\cos(\theta/2)-\frac12\epsilon R\sin(\theta/2)]&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[perpendicular distance]] of the line from the origin. This representation has numerous advantages: One advantage is that there is no need to break into different cases, such as parallel and non-parallel. The other advantage is that these homogeneous coordinates can be interpreted as [[vector (mathematics and physics)|vectors]], allowing us to multiply them by a matrix.

Every Laguerre transformation can be represented as a 2x2 [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] whose entries are dual numbers. Additionally, as long as the determinant of a 2x2 dual-numbered matrix is not [[nilpotent]], then it represents a Laguerre transformation.

== Points, oriented lines and oriented circles ==
Laguerre transformations do not act on points. This is because if three oriented lines pass through the same point, their images under a Laguerre transformation do not have to meet at one point.

Laguerre transformations can be seen as acting on oriented circles as well as oriented lines. An oriented circle is one which either has a [[clockwise]] or [[anti-clockwise]] orientation. An anti-clockwise orientation is considered to be positive, while a clockwise orientation is considered to be negative. The radius of a negatively oriented circle is ''negative''. Whenever a set of oriented lines are tangent to the same oriented circle, their images under a Laguerre transformation share this property, but possibly for a different circle. An oriented line is tangent to an oriented circle if the two figures touch and their orientations agree.

== Profile ==
[[File:Opposite-circles-dilatating2.gif|alt=Two circles with opposite orientations undergoing axial dilatation|thumb|Figure 1: Two circles initially with opposite orientations undergoing axial dilatation]]
The following can be found in [[Isaak Yaglom]]'s ''Complex numbers in geometry''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Mappings of the form &lt;math&gt;z \mapsto \frac{pz - q}{\bar q z + \bar p}&lt;/math&gt; express rigid body motions. The matrix representations of these transformations span a subalgebra isomorphic to the [[dual-complex numbers]].

The mapping &lt;math&gt;z \mapsto -z&lt;/math&gt; represents a reflection about the x-axis, followed by a reversal of orientation.

The transformation &lt;math&gt;z \mapsto 1/z&lt;/math&gt; expresses a reflection about the y-axis, followed by a reversal of orientation.
 
An ''axial dilatation'' by &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; units is a transformation of the form &lt;math&gt;\frac{2z + \epsilon t}{(-\epsilon t) z + 2}&lt;/math&gt;. A dilatation by &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; units increases the radius of all oriented circles by &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; units while preserving their centres. If a circle has negative orientation, then its radius is considered negative, and therefore for some positive values of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; the circle actually shrinks. A progressive dilatation is depicted in Figure 1, in which two circles of opposite orientations undergo the same dilatation.  

On lines, an axial dilatation by &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; units maps any line &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; to a line &lt;math&gt;z'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z'&lt;/math&gt; are parallel, and the perpendicular distance between &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z'&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Lines that are parallel but have opposite orientations move in opposite directions.  
[[File:Mul-by-k.gif|thumb|Figure 2: A grid of lines undergoing &lt;math&gt;z \mapsto kz&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; varying between &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;10&lt;/math&gt;.]]
[[File:Opposite-circles-mul-by-k.gif|thumb|Figure 3: Two circles that initially differ ''only'' in orientation undergoing the transformation &lt;math&gt;z \mapsto kz&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; varying from &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;10&lt;/math&gt;.]]
The transformation &lt;math&gt;z \mapsto k z&lt;/math&gt; for a value of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; that's real preserves the x-intercept of a line, while changing its angle to the x-axis. See Figure 2 to observe the effect on a grid of lines (including the x axis in the middle) and Figure 3 to observe the effect on two circles that differ initially only in orientation (to see that the outcome is sensitive to orientation). 

All Laguerre transformations are either:
* [[Euclidean group|Direct Euclidean isometries]] followed by an axial dilatation.
* [[Euclidean group|Indirect Euclidean isometries]], followed by an axial dilatation, followed by orientation reversal.
* [[Euclidean group|Indirect Euclidean isometries]], followed by a transformation of the form &lt;math&gt;z \mapsto k z&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; a real number, followed by orientation reversal.

The '''Badouel [[ray (geometry)|ray]]-[[triangle]] intersection [[algorithm]]''', named after inventor [[Didier Badouel]], is a fast method for calculating the [[Intersection (Euclidean geometry)|intersection]] of a ray and a triangle in three [[dimension]]s without needing precomputation of the [[plane equation]] of the [[plane (geometry)|plane]] containing the triangle.

A '''buffer''' in [[geographic information system]] (GIS) is a zone around a map feature measured in units of distance or time. A buffer is useful for [[proximity analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Wade, T. and Smmer, S. eds. ''[http://store.esri.com/esri/showdetl.cfm?SID=2&amp;Product_ID=868&amp;Category_ID=49 A to Z GIS]''&lt;/ref&gt;

A buffer is an area defined by the bounding region determined by a set of points at a specified maximum distance from all nodes along segments of an object.
